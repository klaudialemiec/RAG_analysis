Their rights and obligations are determined in the Constitution of Poland. The president heads the executive branch. In addition, the president has the right to dissolve parliament in certain cases, can veto legislation, represents Poland in the international arena, and is the commander-in-chief.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nThe first president of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, was sworn in as president of the Second Polish Republic on 11 December 1922. He was elected by the National Assembly (the Sejm and the Senate) under the terms of the 1921 March Constitution. Narutowicz was assassinated on 16 December 1922. Previously Józef Piłsudski had been \"Chief of State\" (Naczelnik Państwa) under the provisional Small Constitution of 1919. In 1926 Piłsudski staged the \"May Coup\", overthrew President Stanisław Wojciechowski and had the National Assembly elect a new one, Ignacy Mościcki, thus establishing the \"Sanation regime\". Before Piłsudski\\'s death, parliament passed a more authoritarian 1935 April Constitution of Poland (not in accord with the amendment procedures of the 1921 March Constitution).[2] Mościcki continued as president until he resigned in 1939 in the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland. Mościcki and his government went into exile in Romania, where Mościcki was interned. In Angers, France, Władysław Raczkiewicz, at the time the speaker of the Senate, assumed the presidency after Mościcki\\'s resignation on 29 September 1939.[3] Following the fall of France, the president and the Polish government-in-exile were evacuated to London, United Kingdom. The transfer from Mościcki to Raczkiewicz was in accordance with Article 24 of the 1935 April Constitution.[4][5] Raczkiewicz was followed by a succession of presidents in exile, of whom the last one was Ryszard Kaczorowski.\\nIn 1945–54, Poland became a part of Soviet-controlled central-eastern Europe. Bolesław Bierut assumed the reins of government and in July 1945 was internationally recognised as the head of state. The Senate was abolished in 1946 by the Polish people\\'s referendum. When the Sejm passed the Small Constitution of 1947, based in part on the 1921 March Constitution, Bierut was elected president by that body. He served until the Constitution of the Polish People\\'s Republic of 1952 eliminated the office of the president.[6] replacing it with a collective leadership called the Council of State (Polish: Rada Państwa).\\nFollowing the 1989 amendments to the constitution which restored the presidency,[7] general Wojciech Jaruzelski, the existing head of state, took office. In Poland\\'s first direct presidential election, Lech Wałęsa won and was sworn in on 22 December 1990. The office of the president was preserved in the Constitution of Poland passed in 1997; the constitution now provides the requirements for, the duties of and the authority of the office.\\nThe topic of creation the presidency role as a single-person position was meant to safeguard slow, gentle political change to keep the interests of the ruling party. By March 1989, a compromise regarding the creation of the institution of the presidency was reached between the government and the opposition. In return for a constitutionally defined presidency with various competences, the ruling party agreed to relinquish its position as managing organ within the state. The presidency would be created along with the restoration of a freely elected upper house, the Senate. The president would be elected by a joint session of the lower house (Sejm) and the Senate. By this way, representatives of the opposition, sitting in the Senate, would be involved in the political process of electing the president.[8]\\nThe Small constitution of October 17, 1992 created a parliamentarisation of the political system and while the presidency remained in the active model, it was deprived of far-reaching governing powers.\\nIn recent years, newly elected presidents have renounced formal ties with their political party before taking office.\\n\\nElection[edit]\\nThe president of Poland is elected directly by the people to serve for five years and can be reelected only once. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the president is elected by an absolute majority. If no candidate succeeds in passing this threshold, a second round of voting is held with the participation of the two candidates with the largest and second largest number of votes respectively.\\nIn order to be registered as a candidate in the presidential election, one must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election, and collect at least 100,000 signatures of registered voters.\\n\\nPowers[edit]\\nThe Presidential Palace in Warsaw. It serves as the official seat of presidency.\\nArticle 126 paragraph 1 states that the president is the supreme representative of the state, rather than the people, a privilege reserved for the deputies of the Sejm and senators of the Senate. The constitution confirms the president the role of securing the continuity of state authority. The position of the presidency has an arbiter function (while not directly mentioned, unlike France or Romania), with the president playing a major role in the political system, assisted by set of legal instruments with which they can exert influence on the organs of state authority and the political system.[9]\\nThe president has a free choice in selecting the prime minister, yet in practice they usually give the task of forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party with the majority of seats in the Sejm (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).\\nThe president has the right to initiate the legislative process. They also have the opportunity to directly influence it by using their veto to stop a bill; however, a veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the president can also ask the Constitutional Tribunal to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.\\nIn their role as supreme representative of the Polish state, the president has the power to ratify and revoke international agreements, nominates and recalls ambassadors, and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states. The president also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles, as well as state distinctions and orders. In addition, they have the right of clemency, viz. they can dismiss final court verdicts (in practice, the president consults such decisions with the minister of justice).\\n\\nThe president is also the supreme commander of the armed forces; they appoint the chief of the general staff and the commanders of all of the service branches; in wartime they nominate the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and can order a general mobilisation. The president performs their duties with the help of the following offices: the Chancellery of the President, the Office of National Security, and the Body of Advisors to the President.\\nPresidential residencies and properties[edit]\\nThe Belweder Palace, often known simply as \\'Belvedere\\', is the traditional (now secondary) official residence of the president.\\nSeveral properties are owned by the Office of the President and are used by the head of state as their official residence, private residence, residence for visiting foreign officials etc.\\n\\nThe Presidential Palace in Warsaw is the largest palace in Warsaw and the official seat of the president of the Republic of Poland since 1993. The first presidential tenant was Lech Wałęsa when he moved to the Palace from Belweder in 1994.\\nBelweder, in Warsaw, was the official seat of the president until 1993. It is currently owned by the Office of the President as the official residence of the President and is used by the president and the government for ceremonial purposes. The palace also serves as an official residence for heads of state on official visits to Poland and other important guests.\\nThe Presidential Castle in Wisła in a château built for the Habsburgs as their hunting cottage. It was rebuilt 1929–1931 and used as recreational residence by Ignacy Mościcki, President 1916—1939. Since 2002 it is again a property of the president, restored and opened in 2005 by President Kwaśniewski. It is today a recreational and conference centre for the president and a hotel.\\nResidence of the President of the Republic of Poland in Lucień\\nManor House of the President of the Republic of Poland in Ciechocinek\\nPresidential Residence \"Jurata-Hel\" in Hel, the president\\'s Baltic coastal retreat\\nSummer residence at the Hel Peninsula\\nPresidential Villa in Promnik\\nPresidential Villa in Klarysew\\nActing president of Poland[edit]\\nMain article: Acting President of Poland\\nThe office of the president at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw\\nThe constitution states that the president is an elected office, there is no directly elected presidential line of succession. If the president is unable to execute their powers and duties, the marshal of the Sejm will have the powers of a president for a maximum of 60 days until elections are called.\\nOn 10 April 2010, a plane carrying Polish president Lech Kaczyński, his wife, and 94 others including many Polish officials crashed near Smolensk North Airport in Russia; there were no survivors.[10] Bronisław Komorowski took over acting presidential powers following the incident. On 8 July, Komorowski resigned from the office of Marshal of the Sejm after winning the presidential election. According to the constitution, the acting president then became the marshal of the Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz. In the afternoon Grzegorz Schetyna was elected as a new marshal of the Sejm and he became acting president. Schetyna served as the interim head of state until the swearing-in of Komorowski on 6 August.\\n\\nFormer presidents[edit]\\nFurther information: List of heads of state of Poland\\nWithin Poland, former presidents are entitled to lifetime personal security protection by State Protection Service officers, in addition to receiving a substantial pension and a private office. On 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczyński, president at the time, along with Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last president-in-exile although not internationally recognised, died in the crash of a Polish Air Force Tu-154 en route to Russia.[11]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of heads of state of Poland\\nList of Polish monarchs\\nNaczelnik Państwa\\nPolish government-in-exile\\nPolish presidential elections of\\n1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020\\nPrime Minister of Poland\\nSmolensk air disaster\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Zarobki Prezydenta RP\".\\n\\n^ Garlicki, Andrzej (2001). \"Majowa, marcowa, kwietniowa: Kto nam pisał konstytucje (The valley between the March and the April: We who wrote the constitutions)\" (in Polish).

He previously served as the Minister of Public Works from 1920 to 1922 and briefly as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1922. A renowned engineer and politically independent, Narutowicz was the first elected head of state following Poland\\'s regained sovereignty from partitioning powers.\\nBorn into a noble family with the strong patriotic sentiment, Narutowicz studied at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University before relocating to Zurich Polytechnic and completing his studies in Switzerland.[1] An engineer by profession, he was a pioneer of electrification and his works were presented at exhibitions across Western Europe. Narutowicz also directed the construction of the first European hydroelectric power plants in Monthey, Mühleberg and Andelsbuch. In 1907, he was nominated a professor of hydroelectric and water engineering in Zurich, and was subsequently assigned to maintaining the Rhine. In September 1919, Narutowicz was invited by the Polish authorities in rebuilding the nation\\'s infrastructure after the devastation caused by World War I. On 23 June 1920, Narutowicz became the Minister of Public Works in Władysław Grabski’s government. Following his successful conduct of the Polish delegation at the Genoa Conference, on 28 June 1922 he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Artur Śliwiński’s cabinet.\\nDuring the elections in 1922, Narutowicz was supported by the center-left, most notably the Polish People\\'s Party \"Wyzwolenie\", and by national minorities, but was criticized by the right-wing National Democrats. Far-right zealots, ultra-Catholic unions and nationalists targeted him for sympathy towards Polish Jews. Upon defeating the other candidate, Maurycy Zamoyski, Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic. After only five days in office, he was assassinated by a mentally disturbed Eligiusz Niewiadomski while viewing paintings at the Zachęta Art Gallery.[2] His funeral, attended by almost 500,000 people, was simultaneously a manifestation of peace which diminished the power of the far-right movement in the upcoming years. Narutowicz was buried with honors on 22 December 1922 in the vault of St. John\\'s Cathedral in Warsaw.\\nNarutowicz was a non-practicing Catholic and an active Freemason; he participated in rituals throughout the whole country.\\n\\n\\nFamily[edit]\\nGabriel Józef Narutowicz was born into a Polish-Lithuanian noble family in Telšiai, then part of the Russian Empire after the partitioning of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[3] His father, Jan Narutowicz, was a local district judge and landholder in the Samogitian village of Brėvikiai\\xa0[lt]. As a result of his participation in the January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia, he was sentenced to a year in prison; he died when Gabriel was only one.[4]\\nGabriel’s mother, Wiktoria Szczepkowska, was Jan\\'s third wife. Following her husband\\'s death, she raised the sons herself. An educated woman, intrigued by the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment, she had a great influence on the development of Gabriel and his siblings\\' world view. In 1873 she moved to Liepāja, Latvia, so that her children would not be forced to attend a Russian school (Russification in Latvia after the Uprising of 1863 was less enforced than in Lithuania and Poland, the center of the uprising).[5]\\nAn illustration of the dual nature of the family\\'s identity is Gabriel Narutowicz’s brother, Stanisław Narutowicz, who, after Lithuania regained independence in 1918, became a Lithuanian, not Polish, citizen. Earlier, towards the end of World War I, Stanisław had become a member of the Council of Lithuania, the provisional Lithuanian parliament. He was a signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania of 16 February 1918.[6]\\n\\n1865–1920[edit]\\nMemorial plaque commemorating Gabriel Narutowicz (ETH Zurich, 1932)\\nNarutowicz finished his secondary education at the Liepāja Gymnasium, Latvia. He then enrolled at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. Illness, however, caused him to suspend those studies and to later transfer to the Zurich Polytechnic in Switzerland, where he studied from 1887 to 1891.[7]\\nNarutowicz helped exiled Poles on the run from the Russian authorities during his time in Switzerland. He was also connected with a Polish émigré socialist party, \"Proletariat\". As a result of his associations, he was banned from returning to Russia and had a warrant issued for his arrest. In 1895 Narutowicz became a Swiss citizen and, after completing his studies, he was employed as an engineer during the construction of the St. Gallen railway.[8]\\nNarutowicz proved to be an outstanding engineering expert and, in 1895, became chief of works on the River Rhine. Later he was hired by the Kurstein technical office. His works were exhibited at the International Exhibition in Paris (1896), and he would become a famous pioneer of electrification in Switzerland. Narutowicz directed the construction of many other European hydroelectric power plants, such as in Monthey, Mühleberg, and Andelsbuch.\\nIn 1907 he became a professor at ETH Zurich, in the water construction institute in Zurich. He was dean of that institute from 1913 to 1919. He was also a member of the Swiss Committee for Water Economy. In 1915 he was chosen chairman of the International Committee for the regulation of the River Rhine.\\nDuring World War I, he cooperated with the General Swiss Committee tasked with helping victims of the war in Poland and was also a member of La Pologne et la Guerre, located in Lausanne. A follower of the ideas of Józef Piłsudski, in September 1919 Narutowicz was invited by the Polish government to return to Poland to take part in the rebuilding of the nation\\'s infrastructure.[9]\\n\\n1920–22[edit]\\nNarutowicz in his office, just days before the assassination\\nAfter coming back to Poland, on 23 June 1920 Narutowicz became the Minister of Public Works in Władysław Grabski’s government. He held that post until 26 June 1922 (in four different subsequent cabinets: of Władysław Grabski, Wincenty Witos and the first and the second governments of Antoni Ponikowski). After becoming the Minister of Public Works, Narutowicz immediately started to work on the rebuilding of his country, using the experience acquired in Switzerland as a pioneer of electrification. He would soon go about reorganizing the reconstruction bureaucracy and reduce the number of employees fourfold over the course of two years, in that way greatly increasing its efficiency.\\nNarutowicz traveled around the country often to personally supervise and direct public works. By 1921 almost 270,000 buildings and 300 bridges had been rebuilt, most of the roads mended, and about 200\\xa0km of highways added. He also designed dams and supervised the building of a hydroelectric power plant in Porąbka on the river Soła[10] in the Beskid Mountains, and worked on irrigation control of the Vistula River.[11]\\nPolitically he had a reputation as a moderate, reasonable and broad-minded man. He was a member of the government in every subsequent cabinet (a period of constant government crises and turnover). In April 1922, Narutowicz was delegated (together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the time, Konstanty Skirmunt) to participate in the Genoa Conference, and was given credit for the success of the Polish delegation—many Western diplomats had greater trust in the highly respected Narutowicz than in the other government ministers of the newly re-established country.[12]\\nOn 28 June 1922, he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Artur Śliwiński’s government. He also held that post in the later government of Julian Ignacy Nowak. In October 1922, he represented Poland at a conference in Tallinn. In the election of 1922, he supported the center-right National Public Union (Unia Narodowo-Państwowa), connected with Józef Piłsudski. He himself was a candidate of the Public Union on Eastern Borderlands (Państwowe Zjednoczenie na Kresach) but did not gain a seat in Parliament.[13]\\n\\nElections[edit]\\nPresident Gabriel Narutowicz with Marshal Józef Piłsudski in Warsaw, 1922\\nAfter having lost the elections, Narutowicz continued as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Julian Nowak. To his own great surprise that December he was nominated as a candidate for the ensuing presidential election. Although Piłsudski tried to discourage him from becoming a presidential candidate (he himself had originally wanted to decline the nomination, which the Polish People\\'s Party \"Wyzwolenie\" had proposed), he eventually relented and accepted.[14]\\nAccording to the March Constitution of Poland, the president had to be chosen by the National Assembly, that is, the two houses of parliament (Pol: Zgromadzenie Narodowe i.e. the Sejm and the Senate). There was no clear winner after the first round of voting. In the second round, the official socialist candidate, Ignacy Daszyński, was eliminated; but again, there was no clear victor. The next to drop out were the two candidates most favored by representatives of the national minorities: namely, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and Stanisław Wojciechowski (the latter supported by some of the Left). In the last and decisive round, only two candidates remained: Count Maurycy Klemens Zamoyski (backed by the right-wing National Democracy movement) and Narutowicz (supported by some center and left-wing parties as well as by spokesmen for various national minorities).[15]\\n\\nNarutowicz leaving the Polish Sejm after being proclaimed president, 11 December 1922\\nNarutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the National Democracy movement), and of the centrist Polish People’s Party \"Piast\" (PSL \"Piast\"). This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic.[16]\\nNarutowicz\\'s victory came as an extremely unpleasant surprise to various leading right-wingers. Following the election, certain Catholic and nationalist groups began an aggressive campaign against Narutowicz personally. Among other accusations, they called him an atheist and a Freemason, and some of the press referred to him as “the Jewish president”. The anti-Pilsudski faction, supported by General Józef Haller, also criticized the new president\\'s overall support of Piłsudski\\'s policies.[17]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nGabriel Narutowicz served as president of Poland for a mere five days.[18] During his oath of office ceremony on 11 December 1922, members of the National Democracy and others manifested their opposition against the president-elect with anti-government demonstrations in Warsaw. Earlier on that day, opponents of his election attempted to prevent the president-elect from entering the Sejm by blocking the streets and throwing mud at his motorcade. Narutowicz was never comfortable with the widespread belief that he was a representative of the Left in Polish politics. He had only become the candidate of the Polish Peasant Party \"Wyzwolenie\" by happenstance; he had also not expected to win the election (in its first-round Narutowicz gained just 62 votes whereas count Zamoyski had 222).[13]\\nDuring his first days after his taking the oath of office, Gabriel Narutowicz met with the representatives of the Christian Democratic Party and Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski. Narutowicz realized that it would be impossible to form a majority government in the Parliament, so he made an attempt to create a government beyond the purview of parliament. As a gesture to the right wing, he offered the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs to his rival Zamoyski.[19]\\n\\nAssassination[edit]\\nMain article: Assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz\\nNarutowicz lying in state on a bier, 22 December 1922.\\nOnly five days after taking office, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was assassinated while attending an art exhibit in the Zachęta National Gallery of Art.[20][21] The assassin was a painter, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had some connections with the right wing party but became pro Piłsudski since 1905. The assassin was sentenced to death in a 1 day trial and executed outside the Warsaw Citadel on 31 January.[22]\\n\\nIn film[edit]\\nThe murder of Narutowicz was the main theme of the 1977 Polish feature film Death of a President (Pol: Śmierć prezydenta), directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz.[23]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of presidents of Poland\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Gabriel Narutowicz\".

During his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend Józef Piłsudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation. In 1926, Piłsudski staged a military coup, which resulted in Wojciechowski resigning from office.[3][4]\\n\\n\\nEarly life[edit]\\nStanisław Wojciechowski was born on 15 March 1869 in Kalisz into a Polish noble family with strong ties to the intelligentsia. He was one of seven children of Second Lieutenant Feliks Wojciechowski (1825-1881), a caretaker of a prison in Kalisz who participated during the January Uprising, and his wife Florentyna Vorhoff. He was raised in a spirit of patriotism and devotion to his homeland. In 1888, he graduated in the Men\\'s Classical Junior High School in Kalisz and began his studies at the Imperial University of Warsaw where he studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics until 1891. He belonged to the circle of the most active conspirators, participant of the secret student groups for self-improvement. Wojciechowski was active during his studies, first in the conspiratorial organization Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\", and later in the burgeoning socialist movement. By 1892, he had abandoned his studies and chose the life of an exile after his second arrest and detention by the czarist police, first going to Zürich and then Paris. There he learned the trade of typesetter with which he supported himself.[5]\\nIn 1892, Wojciechowski co-founded the Polish Socialist Party and many nationalist and socialists met in Paris. He travelled several more times illegally to Congress Poland and the Russian Empire and smuggled printing machine components and publications into the country. Together with Piłsudski, he formed the backbone of the socialist movement in Russian Poland. In 1899, he married Maria Wojciechowska, a daughter of a wealthy landowner of szlachta descent.[6]\\n\\nPolitical movements and early career[edit]\\nAfter 1905, he left the Polish Socialist Party over disagreements on the political future of Poland and its relations to the international class struggle. During World War I, Stanisław Wojciechowski believed that Germany posed the biggest threat to Poland and thus decided to stay in Russia rather than side with his erstwhile friend Piłsudski. After the Russian evacuation of Congress Poland of 1915, he moved to Moscow where he remained active in Polish political circles. After the fall of the Tsarist regime was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties\\' Union, and heavily engaged on behalf of the Polish Army in Russia in 1918. He was forced to leave Moscow under threat of arrest once the Bolshevik regime seized power. On 15 January 1919, the Chief of State nominated him, Minister of Internal Affairs, in both the Cabinet of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Leopold Skulski, whom Wojciechowski replaced during his numerous absences from the country. During this time, Wojciechowski also participated in the drafting of the Polish constitution.[7]\\n\\n1922 presidential elections[edit]\\nMain article: 1922 Polish presidential elections\\nFirst election[edit]\\nIn the legislative elections, Wojciechowski served as the candidate for the Senate though he failed to win a seat. After the legislative elections, a balance appeared between the left and right forces. This situation also preponderated in the National Assembly, which was to select a new president of Poland and produce a new presidential election. Piłsudski did not want to put up his candidacy, and Wincenty Witos was perceived as a person communicating with the right and not paying attention to the interests of rural villages. Therefore, the Polish People\\'s Party \"Piast\" put forward and appointed Wojciechowski as the new candidate for the presidency not involved in current political games. He accepted this decision, but when the Polish People\\'s Party \"Wyzwolenie\" informed that Gabriel Narutowicz planned to withdraw from the presidential race. Witos persuaded Narutowicz not to do that.\\nWojciechowski was defeated in the fourth ballot to Count Maurycy Zamoyski who received 228 votes and Wojciechowski only reached 152 votes. Ate the time of the elections, the main candidates were Zamoyski and Wojciechowski. Narutowicz\\'s good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of \"Piast\" (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round). Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the National Democracy movement), and of the centrist Polish People\\'s Party \"Piast\". This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic.[8][9]\\n\\nSecond election[edit]\\nFollowing the assassination of President Narutowicz by Eligiusz Niewiadomski on 16 December 1922, Marshal of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, who served briefly as acting head of state after the assassination, set the date of a new presidential election on 20 December 1922. The right-wing put forward the candidacy of Professor Kazimierz Morawski. Wojciechowski was nominated again as a compromise candidate. Władysław Sikorski was also suggested as a compromise. Originally, Wincenty Witos recommended that his own party, PSL, vote for Morawski. The left-wing of PSL opposed this however, and decided to vote for Wojciechowski, in connection with the events that led to the murder of Narutowicz. As a result of the internal party discussion, it was decided to support Wojciechowski\\'s candidacy. In the first round, Wojciechowski secured 298 votes, with Morawski only gaining 221 votes, Wojciechowski won the election and became the second president of Poland.[10] After the election, representatives of the National Assembly appeared in Wojciechowski\\'s residence to notify him about his election as president. He considered that the will of the Sejm and the Senate should be followed. Alfons Erdman appeared at Wojciechowski\\'s office and demanded he abstain from accepting his choice. It was nevertheless too late, Wojciechowski decided that delay in this matter was improper. On 20 December 1922, Wojciechowski took the presidential oath and became president.[8]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nPortrait by Casimir Markievicz (Royal Castle, Warsaw)\\nDuring his presidency, Wojciechowski attempted to be an enthusiastic politician, who was involved in the performance of the government. He actively supported the non-parliamentary ministry of Władysław Sikorski and Władysław Grabski. The height of the president\\'s political influence corresponded with Grabski\\'s cabinet period of activity. Wojciechowski participated in the Political Committee of the Council of Ministers and had an impact on the content of ordinances on the currency reform, created under special powers of attorney granted to the cabinet by the Sejm. Wojciechowski attempted to shape the Polish constitutional system by introducing a constructive vote of no confidence. The mission of forming a new government was entrusted to the leader of the largest group participating in the overthrow of the previous cabinet, and when Wojciechowski failed to select a cabinet, he advocated leaving the old cabinet or establishing a non-parliamentary cabinet. Wojciechowski used this method after the fall of the second cabinet of Wincenty Witos when he committed the purpose of setting a new ministry to Stanisław Thugutt. Another indication of Wojciechowski\\'s constitutional system was the adoption, opposite to the provisions of the constitution that the Sejm was assembling enduringly, and not in the session system. Wojciechowski never closed the session of the Sejm, which was dictated by the constitution.\\nWojciechowski tried to maintain good relations with Józef Piłsudski, who was in perpetual dispute with the succeeding cabinets and some parliamentary groups. The reason for the conflict was the organization of military authorities. Piłsudski always saw Wojciechowski as a person who would take his side. When in June 1923, Stanisław Szeptycki addressed to the Sejm a bill on the highest military authorities, announcing the liquidation of the powerful military council, who Piłsudski served as the chairman, flared up a sharp dispute between him and the Marshal. Wojciechowski tried to settle this dispute. Accordingly, Piłsudski sent a letter to the president in which he addressed him with the words \"You have acted as a hangover in the matter of honour, which does not respect the rights of honour and forgets that honour belongs to people personally, not officially.\" Wojciechowski tried to negotiate between the opposing parties, including took into account the Maciej Rataj\\'s commentaries, who objected to committing the position of Minister of Military Affairs to Sikorski. Piłsudski did not want to compromise and treated Wojciechowski, as what Rataj regarded, defiantly and as a servant.\\n\\nPresident Wojciechowski in Gniezno to tour the Exhibitions of Agriculture and Commerce, 1925\\nWojciechowski with General Mariusz Zaruski, mid 1920s\\nOn 5 September 1924, Wojciechowski visited the Polish city of Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). At the end of Kopernika and Legionów Street, an explosive charge was thrown towards the car where the president was travelling. Fortuitously, the bomb did not explode.. It was believed that the assassin was Stanisław Steiger, an employee of a commercial company and a student of Jewish law, who was immediately arrested and kept in prison throughout the subsequent trial, and was threatened by the death penalty. The first trial against Steiger took place on 15 and 16 September 1924 ere the District Court in Lviv. The prosecutor was Alfred Laniewski, and the defender was lawyer Michał Grek. The Regional Court referred the case to ordinary proceedings with the participation of sworn judges. In the proceedings, Steiger was defended by lawyer Natan Loewenstein. The trial during which Loewenstein gave his defence speech did not take place until 16 December 1925. Steiger spent all this time in custody, but by this time, new circumstances regarding the assassination attempt were revealed. Gratitude to the lawyer\\'s speech, which Loewenstein published in Lviv a year later, the accused was cleared of the charges and acquitted. The suspect of the assassination ended up being Teofil Olszewski, from the Ukrainian Military Organization, who subsequently fled Poland by illegally crossing the German border near Bytom and was arrested by the Germans on 3 October 1924. Olszewski was convicted of crossing the border illegally for two weeks in prison, suspended for one year, and then granted political refugee status in Germany and permission to settle in Marienburg (Malbork), close to the Polish border.\\nOn 7 May 1925, Wojciechowski travelled from Warsaw to Kraków with the entire ceremonial held by the president. After receiving a report at the station from the commander of the honour company, Wojciechowski asked him if the soldiers were singing religious songs. After receiving a proof answer, Wojciechowski instructed the soldiers to sing some of them. They sang for about twenty minutes until the train left. Such behaviour of the president caused an understandable sensation in the country.[11]\\n\\nFall from power[edit]\\nMain article: May Coup (Poland)\\nPresident Wojciechowski\\'s handwritten description of his meeting with Piłsudski on the Poniatowski Bridge during the May Coup in 1926\\nIn November 1925, the government of Prime Minister Władysław Grabski was replaced by the government of Aleksander Skrzyński, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party. General Lucjan Żeligowski became the new government\\'s minister of military affairs.  However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, formed by Polish People\\'s Party \"Piast\" and Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from Józef Piłsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d\\'état. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on 16 October. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day Józef Piłsudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier) newspaper, said that he was \"ready to fight the evil\" of sejmocracy and promised a \"sanation\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities.\\nThe night of 11 to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembertów, where they pledged their support to Piłsudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wisła River. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos\\' government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Piłsudski met Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Major Marian Porwit who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Piłsudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Piłsudski demanded the resignation of Witos\\' cabinet, while the President demanded Piłsudski\\'s capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president\\'s departure, Major Porwit refused Piłsudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos\\' cabinet decided to move from Belweder to Wilanów. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. \\nAfter transferring to Wilanów, Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to Poznań and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Piłsudski as the new Minister of Military Affairs. On 31 May 1926, the National Assembly nominated Piłsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mościcki became the new president; Piłsudski, however, wielded much greater  de facto power than his military ministry nominally gave him.[9]\\n\\nLater life[edit]\\nScientific career[edit]\\nFollowing the resignation, Wojciechowski worked as a lecturer at the Warsaw School of Economics and the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. Wojciechowski served as the Director of the Cooperative Scientific Institute and later sat on the Scientific Council of the Institute. He published hermetic publications on cooperative activity, which he engaged in before he became an active politician. He wrote books such as the Organization of Agricultural Products Sales and the History of Polish Cooperatives until 1914. In 1937, he was the co-founder of the opposition Labor Party.[12]\\n\\nSecond World War[edit]\\nWojciechowski with his wife Maria Kiersnowska (right) after being expelled from Warsaw at the end of the Warsaw Uprising (October 1944)\\nOn 10 November 1939, the Gestapo arrested Wojciehowski\\'s son, Edmund, as part of German AB-Aktion in Poland, and threatened with execution, as were other representatives of the Polish intelligentsia. Edmund was later released on 4 April 1940 because of Jerzy Antoni Potocki. He was later arrested again on 12 July 1940 because he was one of the 70 Warsaw lawyers who refused to remove Jewish associates from the Warsaw Bar Council. The Germans offered his release in exchange for Wojciechowski signing a declaration stating that the Polish government-in-exile was constitutionally illegal. Wojciechowski refused to sign the declaration and Edmund was transferred on 15 August 1940 to the Auschwitz as one of the 1666 people of the first transport from Warsaw, where he soon died of typhus on 23 February 1941.[13] The family received a telegram sent from the concentration camp informing Wojciechowski about his son\\'s passing, and soon an urn of ashes containing the remains of Edmund was sent back to his parents. During the Warsaw Uprising, the ill Wojciechowski along with his wife Maria were rounded up by the Nazis and sent to Durchgangslager 121, a transit camp in Pruszków. Thanks to the efforts of the Polish sanitary staff, the German medical commission managed to release the former President from the camp.[14]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nThe grave of Stanisław Wojciechowski, his wife and son in Powązki cemetery\\nAfter the war, Wojciechowski retired to private life and died in Gołąbki (now Ursus) in 1953, at the age of 84. He was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.[15]\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\nWojciechowski experienced a political life similar to that of many Central European politicians during the early 20th century. A radical in his youth, his ideology matured and grew more conservative with age. He was at the forefront of over a quarter-century of Polish political development and is considered one of the founders of the modern independent Polish state. Historians unanimously indicate that Wojciechowski remains a figure greatly underrated and believe that it should be remembered that his presidency fell on a particularly turbulent period in Polish history. He managed to make history as an outstanding politician and statesman and is remembered as a relentless defender of democratic values and a prominent patriot.[16]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of presidents of Poland\\nPolish Socialist Party\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Stanisław Wojciechowski – President of Another Century\".

He was the longest serving president in Polish history.[2] Mościcki was the President of Poland when Germany invaded the country on 1 September 1939 and started World War II.\\n\\n\\nEarly life and career[edit]\\nMościcki was born on 1 December 1867 in Mierzanowo, a small village near Ciechanów, Congress Poland. After completing school in Warsaw, he studied chemistry at the Riga Polytechnicum, where he joined the Polish underground leftist organization, Proletariat.[3]\\nUpon graduating, he returned to Warsaw but was threatened by the Tsarist secret police with life imprisonment in Siberia and was forced to emigrate in 1892 to London. In 1896, he was offered an assistantship at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. There, he patented a method for cheap industrial production of nitric acid.\\nIn 1912, Mościcki moved to Lviv (Polish: Lwów), in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in Austria-Hungary, where he accepted a chair in physical chemistry and technical electrochemistry at the Lviv Polytechnic.[4] In 1925, he was elected rector of the Lwów Polytechnic (as it was then called), but soon moved to Warsaw to continue his research at the Warsaw Polytechnic. In 1926, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society.[5]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nMościcki bestows the bulawa (the Marshal of Poland\\'s baton) on Edward Rydz-Śmigły\\nAfter Józef Piłsudski\\'s May 1926 coup d\\'état on 1 June 1926, Mościcki, once an associate of Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party, was elected President of Poland by the National Assembly on the recommendation of Piłsudski, who had refused the post for himself.[6]\\nAs president, Mościcki was subservient to Piłsudski and never openly showed dissent from any aspect of the Marshal\\'s leadership. After Piłsudski\\'s death in 1935, his followers divided into three main factions: those supporting Mościcki as Piłsudski\\'s successor, those supporting General Edward Rydz-Śmigły and those supporting Prime Minister Walery Sławek.\\nWith a view to eliminating Sławek from the game, Mościcki concluded a power-sharing agreement with Rydz-Śmigły, which had caused Sławek to be marginalised as a serious political player by the end of the year. As a result of the agreement, Rydz-Śmigły would become the de facto leader of Poland until the outbreak of the war, and Mościcki remained influential by continuing in office as president.\\nMościcki was the leading moderate figure in the regime, which was referred to as the \"colonels\\' government\" because of the major presence of military officers in the Polish government. Mościcki opposed many of the nationalist excesses of the more right-wing Rydz-Śmigły, but their pact remained more or less intact.\\nMościcki remained president until September 1939, when he was interned in Romania[7] after the German invasion of Poland and was forced by France to resign his office. He transferred the office to General Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, who held it for only one day before General Władysław Sikorski and the French government ousted him in favour of Władysław Raczkiewicz.\\n\\nFirst family of Poland (1930)\\nLater life[edit]\\nMościcki\\'s grave in the basement of the St. John\\'s Archcathedral, Warsaw\\nMościcki was planning to leave for Switzerland after leaving office as president. From 1908 to 1920, he was a citizen of Switzerland; he was also an honorary citizen of Fribourg. The Romanian authorities gave their provisional consent to his departure, but Germany opposed it. Mościcki was offered to United States President Franklin Roosevelt, who was determined to have Mościcki go to Switzerland. The intervention of the US government forced the Romanian authorities to agree. General Sikorski also ordered the Polish embassy in Bucharest to provide all assistance to Mościcki. The president stayed in Romania until December 1939.[8]\\nMościcki came to Switzerland through Milan, where he met with Wieniawa-Długoszowski. Initially, he lived in Fribourg, where he was allowed to continue his scientific work. During this period, among others, he wrote down his memories, which were published by the New York City magazine Independence. Mościcki donated money to soldiers of the Polish Army in France, Warsaw residents in prisoner-of-war camps, concentration camps and labour camps. For five months, he taught at the University of Fribourg. Later, he was forced to take up paid work. In 1940, he moved to Geneva, where he worked in the Hydro-Nitro Chemical Laboratory.\\nMościcki\\'s health deteriorated rapidly after 1943. He died on 2 October 1946, in Versoix, near Geneva.\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\nIn 1984, his descendants requested for the remains of Mościcki and his wife to be moved from Switzerland to Poland. The relevant Polish authorities agreed that a funeral was to be held in Warsaw and be completely private, without any state ceremonies. However, the authorities of the Canton of Geneva in Switzerland withdrew their agreement for political reasons after protests related to Solidarity from emigrants. In 1993, Mościcki\\'s remains were transported, on behalf of incumbent President Lech Wałęsa, to Poland and deposited in the crypt of St. John\\'s Archcathedral, Warsaw. Mościcki\\'s symbolic grave is located in the Avenue of Merit at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw, where his second wife is buried next to him.[9]\\n\\nGallery[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident of Poland in around 1928\\n\\n\\n\\nPolish president on presidential yacht in Augustów, 1932\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Mościcki in his office, 1934\\n\\n\\n\\nApril\\'s Constitution\\n\\n\\n\\nSession of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1933\\n\\n\\n\\nPlaque commemorating Mościcki\\'s stay as a refugee in the Mihail Constantine Palace in Romania.\\n\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nInvasion of Poland\\nMościce\\nList of Poles\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Last Prewar President Buried in Poland\".

He was the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers\\' Party between 1981 and 1989, making him the last leader of the Polish People\\'s Republic. Jaruzelski served as Prime Minister from 1981 to 1985, the Chairman of the Council of State from 1985 to 1989 and briefly as President of Poland from 1989 to 1990, when the office of President was restored after 37 years. He was also the last commander-in-chief of the Polish People\\'s Army, which in 1990 became the Polish Armed Forces. \\nBorn to Polish nobility in Kurów in eastern (then-central) Poland, Jaruzelski was deported with his family to Siberia by the NKVD after the invasion of Poland. Assigned to forced labour in the Siberian wilderness, he developed photokeratitis which forced him to wear protective sunglasses for the rest of his life. In 1943, Jaruzelski joined the newly created First Polish Army and fought alongside the Soviets against Nazi Germany in the Eastern Front, most notably in the liberation of Warsaw and in the Battle of Berlin. Following the Polish October and the expatriation of Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky back to the Soviet Union, Jaruzelski became the chief political officer of the Polish People\\'s Army and eventually Polish Minister of Defence in 1968.\\nJaruzelski became the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers\\' Party and leader of Poland after the brief one-year term of Stanisław Kania. Kania\\'s predecessor, Edward Gierek, left Poland severely indebted by accepting loans from foreign creditors and the country\\'s economy almost collapsed by the time Jaruzelski became head of state. As Poland headed towards insolvency, rationing was enforced due to shortages of basic goods, which only contributed to the tense social and political situation. The declining living and working conditions triggered anger among the masses and strengthened anti-communist sentiment; the Solidarity union was also gaining support which worried the Polish Central Committee and the Soviet Union that viewed Solidarity as a threat to the Warsaw Pact. Fearing a Soviet intervention similar to those in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968), Jaruzelski imposed martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981 to crush the anti-communist opposition. The military junta, curfew and travel restrictions lasted until 22 July 1983.\\nBy the mid-1980s, censorship lost its importance and the authority of the United Workers\\' Party disintegrated, allowing more freedom of expression in Poland. During the revolutions of 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe, Jaruzelski supported the change of government for the benefit of the country and resigned after the Polish Round Table Agreement, which led to multi-party elections in Poland. He briefly served as President of Poland but exercised no real power and, in the 1990 Polish presidential election, Lech Wałęsa succeeded him as the first President elected in a popular vote. \\nHaving served as the country\\'s leader during its turbulent final years of communist rule, Jaruzelski remains a controversial figure in Poland to this day. He was praised for allowing the country\\'s peaceful transition into democracy, but was also fiercely criticized by contemporaries for his imposition of martial law, including his government\\'s violent suppression of protests and imprisonment of thousands of opposition activists without definite charges, among other human rights violations.\\n\\n\\nEarly life[edit]\\nWojciech Witold Jaruzelski was born on 6 July 1923 in Kurów,[1] into a family of Polish gentry.[1][2]  He was the son of Wanda (née Zaremba) and Władysław Mieczysław Jaruzelski, a Czech-educated agronomist and volunteered soldier who fought in the war against Soviet Russia in 1920[3][4] and was raised on the family estate near Wysokie (in the vicinity of Białystok).[5] From 1933 until September 1939, he was educated in a Catholic school in Warsaw where he received strict religious education.[3][1]\\nWorld War II commenced on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany, aided by the Soviet invasion of Poland sixteen days later. These resulted in the complete defeat of Poland by October and a partition between Soviet and German zones of control. Jaruzelski and his family fled to Lithuania to stay with some friends. However, a few months later, after Lithuania and the other Baltic states were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, Jaruzelski and his family were captured by the Red Army and designated for deportation to Siberia.[1][6]\\nIn June 1941, they were stripped of their valuable possessions and deported. At the railway station, Jaruzelski was separated from his father, who was sent directly to a gulag. Jaruzelski and his mother were sent on a month-long journey to Biysk, Altai Krai. After that, Jaruzelski walked for 180 kilometres (110\\xa0mi) to Turochak where he was responsible for forest cleaning.[3][7] During his labour work, he was stricken with snow blindness, suffering permanent damage to his eyes as well as to his back.[2] His eye condition forced him to wear dark sunglasses most of the time for the rest of his life, which became his trademark.[6] Jaruzelski\\'s father died on 4 June 1942 from dysentery; his mother and sister survived the war (she died in 1966).\\n\\nMilitary career[edit]\\nSee also: Anti-Zionist purge in the Polish Army\\nJaruzelski in 1968\\nJaruzelski was selected by the Soviet authorities for enrollment into the Soviet Officer Training School.[1]  During his time in the Kazakh Republic, Jaruzelski wanted to join the non-Soviet controlled Polish exile army led by Władysław Anders,[7] but in 1943,[8] by which time the Soviet Union was fighting in Europe against Germany in the Eastern Front, he joined the Polish army units being formed under Soviet command.[2] He served in this Soviet-controlled First Polish Army during the war.[1] He participated in the 1945 Soviet military takeover of Warsaw and the Battle of Berlin.[1] By the time the war ended that year, he had gained the rank of lieutenant.[2]  He \"further credited himself in Soviet eyes\"[1] by engaging in combat against the non-Communist Polish Home Army, from 1945 to 1947.[1]\\nAfter the end of the war, Jaruzelski graduated from the Polish Higher Infantry School and then from the General Staff Academy.[8]  He joined Poland\\'s Communist party, the Polish United Workers\\' Party, in 1948[8] and became an informant for the Soviet supervised Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army using the cover name Wolski.[9]  In the initial post-war years, he was among those who fought the Polish anti-Communists (\"cursed soldiers\") in the Świętokrzyskie region. A BBC News profile of Jaruzelski states that his career \"took off after the departure [from Poland] in 1956 of Polish-born Soviet Marshal, Konstantin Rokossovsky\",[2] who had been Poland\\'s Commander in Chief and Minister of Defence.[2]  Jaruzelski was elected to be a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers\\' Party[8][10] and became the Chief Political Officer of the Polish armed forces in 1960, its chief of staff in 1964; and Polish Minister of Defence in 1968,[2] succeeding in the latter post Marshal Marian Spychalski persecuted in the years 1948-1956, albeit without the rank.[11]\\n\\nJaruzelski (right) with Fidel Castro (left) in Poland, May 1972\\nIn August 1968, Jaruzelski, as the defence minister, ordered the 2nd Army under General Florian Siwicki (of the \"LWP\") to invade Czechoslovakia, resulting in military occupation of northern Czechoslovakia until 11 November 1968 when under his orders and agreements with the Soviet Union his Polish troops were withdrawn and replaced by the Soviet Army. In 1970, he was involved in the successful plot against Władysław Gomułka, which led to the appointment of Edward Gierek as General Secretary of the Polish United Workers Party. There is some question whether he took part in organising the brutal suppression of striking workers; or whether his orders to the Communist military led to massacres in the coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg and Szczecin. As Minister of Defense, General Jaruzelski was ultimately responsible for 27,000 troops used against unarmed civilians.[12] He claims that he was circumvented, which is why he never apologised for his involvement.[12] Jaruzelski became a candidate member for the Politburo of the Polish United Workers\\' Party, the chief executive body of the party, obtaining full membership the following year.[1]\\n\\nLeader of the Polish military government[edit]\\nJaruzelski in a television studio, preparing to announce the imposition of martial law, 1981\\nOn 11 February 1981, Jaruzelski was named Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister).  On 18 October, Stanisław Kania was ousted as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers\\' Party after a listening device recorded him criticising the Soviet leadership. Jaruzelski was elected his successor, becoming the only professional soldier to become the leader of a ruling European Communist party.[6][8]\\nA fortnight after taking power, Jaruzelski met with Solidarity head Lech Wałęsa and Catholic bishop Józef Glemp, and hinted that he wanted to bring the church and the union into a sort of coalition government. However, his intention was to crush Solidarity.[13] As early as September, while he was still merely prime minister, he met with his aides to find an excuse to impose martial law.[13] On 13 December, citing purported recordings of Solidarity leaders planning a coup, Jaruzelski organised his own coup by proclaiming martial law.[6]  A Military Council of National Salvation was formed, with Jaruzelski as chairman. A BBC News profile of Jaruzelski contends that the establishment of martial law was \"an attempt to suppress the Solidarity movement.\"[2]\\nProtests held in response to martial law were violently suppressed by the military of paramilitary units mostly by the use of water cannons, tear gas, batons, truncheons, and clubs, with one notable exception in Wujek: following a \"shoot-to-kill\" order, ZOMO units opened fire on demonstrators there, killing nine and wounding 21 others. The total number of deaths during martial law, while still uncertain and subject to dispute, is estimated to be 91 in total.[14]\\n\\nJaruzelski (second from right) with other communist leaders and members of the Warsaw Pact, Berlin, 1987\\nIn 1982, Jaruzelski helped reorganise the Front of National Unity, the organisation the Communists used to manage their satellite parties, as the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth.[15] At the invitation of Jaruzelski, a delegation of the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers\\' Party visited Poland between 27 and 29 December of that year, with the Hungarian delegation sharing their experiences on crushing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.[16]\\nIn spite of severe economic sanctions introduced by the Reagan Administration, martial law was largely successful in suppressing and demoralising the opposition, marginalising the Solidarity movement until the late 1980s. As demonstrators gradually declined towards the end of 1982, martial law was suspended on 31 December of that year, and was formally lifted (along with the final restrictions) on 22 July 1983.\\nIn 1985, Jaruzelski resigned as prime minister and defence minister and became the Chairman of the Polish Council of State, a post equivalent to that of the head of state of Poland. However, his power centered on and firmly entrenched in his coterie of \"LWP\" generals and lower ranks officers of the Polish Communist Army.[15] There were plans in the government circles to award him the rank of Marshal of Poland, ultimately abandoned largely due to his own negative attitude towards the proposal.\\nSubsequent years saw his government and its internal security forces censor, persecute, and jail thousands of journalists and opposition activists without charge. The socio-economic crisis deepened even more than in the late 1970s and rationing of basic foods such as sugar, milk, and meat, as well as materials such as gasoline and consumer products, continued while the median income of the population fell by as much as 10 percent. During Jaruzelski\\'s rule from 1981 to 1989, between 100,000 and 300,000 people left the country.[15]\\n\\nJustification for imposing martial law[edit]\\nSee also: Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981\\nAccording to Jaruzelski, an internal crackdown on solidarity through martial law was necessary to avoid a Soviet invasion.[17]  In a May 1992 interview with Der Spiegel, Jaruzelski said: \"Given the strategic logic of the time, I probably would have acted the same way if I had been a Soviet general. At that time, Soviet political and strategic interests were threatened.\"[18]  Jaruzelski also claimed in 1997 that Washington had given him a \"green light\", stating that he had sent Eugeniusz Molczyk to confer with Vice-President George H. W. Bush, who had agreed with Molczyk that martial law was the lesser of two evils.[19]  Whether this meeting with the American vice-president occurred is disputed. While it is erroneously cited,[clarification needed] Harvard historian Mark Kramer has pointed out that no documents support Jaruzelski\\'s claim.[15] At a press conference in September of that same year, however, former Warsaw Pact forces supreme commander Viktor Kulikov denied that the Soviet Union had either threatened or intended to intervene.[20]\\nHistorical evidence released under Boris Yeltsin\\'s presidency paints a more complicated picture: while Eastern Bloc countries were fully in favour of a crackdown on Solidarity, minutes from Politburo, Warsaw Pact and special commission meetings from the year leading up martial law details strong internal divisions on the question of intervening: Senior Soviet party figures and ministers in a special commission formed to respond to developments in Poland, such as Mikhail Suslov, Yuri Andropov, Andrei Gromyko, and Dmitriy Ustinov were reluctant to intervene, citing the 1970 Polish protests and the ongoing Soviet-Afghan war,[21] while the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, along with East German and Czechoslovak leaders Erich Honecker and Gustáv Husák, expressed a strong willingness to intervene if necessary.[22] To this end, plans were made for a joint Soviet, East German, and Czechoslovak attack under the pretext of a Warsaw Pact military exercise called \\'Soyuz-80,\\' (dubbed Operation Krkonoše in Czechoslovakia) on December 1980;[22][23] Before it could be carried out, Brezhnev was convinced by Kania to postpone the planned invasion in order to give Polish leadership a chance.\\nBy the time of Jaruzelski\\'s rise to power, the Soviet leadership\\'s anti-intervention faction had prevailed thanks to the influence of Andropov, who at this point was already a highly influential figure in the Politburo: minutes from their 29 October 1981 meeting details a discussion of Jaruzelski\\'s demands for military support if he failed to control the situation, which were unanimously rejected.[22] Contrary to his public statements after the fact, Jaruzelski was in fact highly insistent on Warsaw Pact military support.[12] Following a long back-and-forth at Warsaw Pact and Politburo meetings, in which even a proposed bluffing statement of support was vetoed by Romania,[22][24] any notion of a Warsaw Pact intervention was firmly and consequently shut down by Andropov in a Politburo meeting three days before Jaruzelski\\'s proclamation: \"We do not intend to introduce troops into Poland. That is the proper position, and we must adhere to it until the end. I don\\'t know how things will turn out in Poland, but even if Poland falls under the control of Solidarity, that\\'s the way it will be.\"[25][15]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nJaruzelski with Nicolae Ceaușescu\\nThe policies of Mikhail Gorbachev stimulated political reform in Poland as well as in other communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.[26]\\nFrom 6 February to 4 April 1989, negotiations were held between 13 working groups during 94 sessions of the roundtable talks. These negotiations \"radically altered the shape\" of the Polish government and society, and resulted in an agreement which stated that a great degree of political power would be given to a newly created bicameral legislature. It also restored a post of president to act as head of state and chief executive. Solidarity was also declared a legal organisation. During the ensuing partially-free elections, the Communists and their allies were allocated 65 percent of the seats in the Sejm. Solidarity won all the remaining elected seats, and 99 out of the 100 seats in the fully elected Senate were also won by Solidarity-backed candidates.[1] Amid such a crushing defeat, there were fears Jaruzelski would annul the results.  However, he allowed them to stand.[27] Jaruzelski was elected by parliament to the position of president. He was the only candidate.\\nJaruzelski was unsuccessful in convincing Lech Wałęsa to include Solidarity in a \"grand coalition\"[1] with the Communists. He resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July 1989.[1][28] Mieczysław Rakowski succeeded him as party leader.[28]\\nThe Communists initially intended to give Solidarity a few token cabinet posts for the sake of appearances.  However,  Wałęsa persuaded the Communists\\' two allied parties, the United People\\'s Party (ZSL) and the Alliance of Democrats (SD), to break their alliance with the PZPR.[29] Accepting that he would have to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister, Jaruzelski then asked Wałęsa to select three candidates, one of whom he would ask to form a government. Ultimately, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who had helped organise the roundtable talks, was selected as first non-Communist prime minister of an Eastern Bloc country in four decades.[30] Jaruzelski resigned as president in 1990.[1] He was succeeded by Wałęsa, who had won the presidential election on 9 December.[31]\\nOn 31 January 1991, Jaruzelski retired from the army.[32]\\n\\nAfter retirement[edit]\\nJaruzelski in 2006\\nIn October 1994, while attending a book-selling activity in Wroclaw, Jaruzelski was attacked by a male pensioner with a stone; his jaw was injured, requiring surgery. The attacker, who had been imprisoned during the martial law period, was sentenced to two years\\' imprisonment and fined 2,000,000 złoty.[33]\\nIn an interview in 2001, Jaruzelski said that he believed communism failed and that he was now a social democrat.  He also announced his support for President Aleksander Kwaśniewski and Leszek Miller, later Prime Minister. Both Kwaśniewski and Miller were members of the Democratic Left Alliance, the social democratic party that included most of the remains of the PZPR.[7]\\nIn May 2005, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded a medal commemorating the 60th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany to Jaruzelski and other former leaders, including former Romanian King Michael I.[34] Czech President Václav Klaus criticised this step, saying that Jaruzelski was a symbol of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Jaruzelski said that he had apologised and that the decision on the August 1968 invasion had been a great \"political and moral mistake\".[35]\\nOn 28 March 2006, Jaruzelski was awarded a Siberian Exiles Cross by Polish President Lech Kaczyński. However, after making this fact public, Kaczyński said that this was a mistake and blamed his staff for giving him a document containing 1,293 names without notifying him of Jaruzelski\\'s inclusion. After this statement, Jaruzelski returned the cross.[36][37]\\nOn 31 March 2006, the IPN charged Jaruzelski with committing communist crimes, mainly the creation of a criminal military organisation with the aim of carrying out criminal acts—mostly concerned with the illegal imprisonment of people. A second charge involved inciting state ministers to commit acts beyond their competence.[37] Jaruzelski evaded most court appearances, citing poor health. In December 2010, Jaruzelski suffered from severe pneumonia[38] and, in March 2011, he was diagnosed with lymphoma.[39]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nJaruzelski\\'s grave at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw\\nJaruzelski died on 25 May 2014 in a Warsaw hospital after suffering a stroke earlier that month.[40][41] He had reportedly requested last rites by a Catholic priest.[42][43] President Bronisław Komorowski, former Presidents Lech Wałęsa and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, and hundreds of other Poles attended his funeral mass at the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army in Warsaw on 30 May. Wałęsa and Komorowski, who were among the thousands imprisoned during the crackdown on Solidarity in 1981, both said that judgment against Jaruzelski \"would be left to God\".[43][44] Jaruzelski was cremated and buried with full military honours at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw, near the grave of Bolesław Bierut, the first Communist leader of Poland after World War II.[45] The decision to bury Jaruzelski at Powązki, the burial place of Polish soldiers killed defending their country since the early 19th century, caused protests.[42]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nJaruzelski married Barbara Halina Jaruzelska (1931–2017)[46] in 1961.[47] They had a daughter, Monika who was born on 11 August 1963. Monika has a son, Gustaw.\\nIn 2014, his wife Barbara threatened to file for divorce, saying she had caught his nurse Dorota in a compromising position with him.[48][49]\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\nThe BBC reported in 2001 that \"for some Poles — particularly the Solidarity generation — he is little short of a traitor\". However, opinion polls as of 15 May 2001 suggested that a majority of the Polish people were open to agreeing with his explanation that martial law was implemented to forestall a Soviet invasion.[2] In interviews in Russian media (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, for example), he has been presented as the harbinger of Poland\\'s democracy.[50]\\nCroatian writer Slavenka Drakulić described Jaruzelski as a \"tragic believer in Communism who made a pact with the devil in good faith\".[51]\\n\\nWritten works[edit]\\nRóżnić się mądrze (English translation: To Differ Wisely; 1999).[8]\\n\"Być może to ostatnie słowo (wyjaśnienia złożone przed Sądem)\" (English translation: \"It may be the last word (explanations given in the Court)\"; 2008).\\n\\nHonours and awards[edit]\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

After winning the 1990 election, Wałęsa became the first democratically elected president of Poland since 1926 and the first-ever Polish president elected by popular vote. A shipyard electrician by trade, Wałęsa became the leader of the Solidarity movement and led a successful pro-democratic effort, which in 1989 ended Communist rule in Poland and ushered in the end of the Cold War.\\nWhile working at the Lenin Shipyard (now Gdańsk Shipyard), Wałęsa, an electrician, became a trade-union activist, for which he was persecuted by the government, placed under surveillance, fired in 1976, and arrested several times. In August 1980, he was instrumental in political negotiations that led to the ground-breaking Gdańsk Agreement between striking workers and the government. He co-founded the Solidarity trade-union, whose membership rose to over ten million.\\nAfter martial law in Poland was imposed and Solidarity was outlawed, Wałęsa was again arrested. Released from custody, he continued his activism and was prominent in the establishment of the Round Table Agreement that led to the semi-free 1989 Polish legislative election and a Solidarity-led government. He presided over Poland\\'s transition from Marxist–Leninist state socialism into a free-market capitalist liberal democracy, but his active role in Polish politics diminished after he narrowly lost the 1995 Polish presidential election. In 1995, he established the Lech Wałęsa Institute.\\nSince 1980, Wałęsa has received hundreds of prizes, honors and awards from multiple countries and organizations worldwide. He was named the Time Person of the Year (1981) and one of Time\\'s 100 most important people of the 20th century (1999). He has received over forty honorary degrees, including from Harvard University and Columbia University, as well as dozens of the highest state orders, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and the French Grand Cross of Legion of Honour. In 1989, Wałęsa was the first foreign non-head of state to address the Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress. The Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport has borne his name since 2004.[1]\\n\\n\\nEarly life[edit]\\nWałęsa was born in Popowo, Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, Germany (German-occupied Poland).[2] His father, Bolesław Wałęsa (1908–1945), was a carpenter who was rounded up and interned in a forced labour camp at Młyniec (outpost of KL Stutthof) by the German occupying forces before Lech was born.[c] Bolesław returned home after the war but died two months later from exhaustion and illness.[4] Lech\\'s mother, Feliksa Wałęsa (née Kamieńska; 1916–1975),[5] has been credited with shaping her son\\'s beliefs and tenacity.[6]\\nWhen Lech was nine, Feliksa married her brother-in-law, Stanisław Wałęsa (1916–1981), a farmer.[7] Lech had three elder full siblings; Izabela (1934–2012),[d] Edward (born 1937), and Stanisław (born 1939); and three younger half-brothers; Tadeusz (born 1946), Zygmunt (born 1948), and Wojciech (1951–1988).[8] In 1973, Lech\\'s mother and stepfather emigrated to the US for economic reasons.[7] They lived in Jersey City, New Jersey, where Feliksa died in a car accident in 1975, and Stanisław died of a heart attack in 1981.[7] Both of them were buried in Poland.[8]\\nIn 1961, Lech graduated from primary and vocational school in nearby Chalin and Lipno as a qualified electrician. He worked as a car mechanic from 1961 to 1965, and then embarked on his two-year, obligatory military service, attaining the rank of corporal before beginning work on 12 July 1967 as an electrician at Lenin Shipyard (Stocznia Gdańska im. Lenina), now called Gdańsk Shipyard (Stocznia Gdańska) in Gdańsk.[9]\\n\\nSolidarity movement[edit]\\nMain article: Solidarity (Polish trade union)\\nWojciech Harasiewicz with Lech Wałęsa\\nFrom early in his career, Wałęsa was interested in workers\\' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes.[10] He was a charismatic leader,[11] who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government\\'s decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee.[2][10] The strikes\\' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa\\'s views on the need for change.[10] In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests.[2][10][12] Afterwards, he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods.[10] Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged.[10] Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.[2]\\n\\nWałęsa during the strike at the Lenin Shipyard, August 1980\\nWałęsa worked closely with the Workers\\' Defence Committee (KOR), a group that emerged to lend aid to people arrested after the 1976 labor strikes and to their families.[2] In June 1978, he became an activist of the underground Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża).[12] On 14 August 1980, another rise in food prices led to a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, of which Wałęsa was one of the instigators. Wałęsa climbed over the shipyard fence and quickly became one of the strike leaders.[2][10] The strike inspired other similar strikes in Gdańsk, which then spread across Poland. Wałęsa headed the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, coordinating the workers at Gdańsk and at 20 other plants in the region.[2] On 31 August, the government, represented by Mieczysław Jagielski, signed an accord (the Gdańsk Agreement) with the Strike Coordinating Committee.[2] The agreement granted the Lenin Shipyard workers the right to strike and permitted them to form an independent trade union.[13] The Strike Coordinating Committee legalized itself as the National Coordinating Committee of the Solidarność (Solidarity) Free Trade Union, and Wałęsa was chosen as chairman of the committee.[2][12] The Solidarity trade union quickly grew, ultimately claiming over 10 million members—more than a quarter of Poland\\'s population.[14] Wałęsa\\'s role in the strike, in the negotiations, and in the newly formed independent trade union gained him fame on the international stage.[2][10]\\n\\nWałęsa signs autographs during the strike in August 1980.\\nOn 10 March 1981, through the introduction of his former superior in the army, Wałęsa met Wojciech Jaruzelski for the first time in the office building of the Council of Ministers for three hours. During the meeting, Jaruzelski and Wałęsa agreed that mutual trust was necessary if the problems of Poland were to be solved. Wałęsa said \"It\\'s not the case that the name of socialism is bad. Only some people spoiled the name of socialism\". He also complained about and criticized the government. Jaruzelski informed Wałęsa of the coming war games of the Warsaw Pact from 16 to 25 March, hoping he could help maintain the social order and avoid anti-Soviet remarks. Jaruzelski also reminded Wałęsa that Solidarity had used foreign funds. Wałęsa joked \"We don\\'t have to take only dollars. We can take corn, fertilizer, anything is okay. I told Mr. Kania before that I would take everything from the enemy. The more the better, until the enemy was weakened no more\".[15]\\n[16]\\nWałęsa held his position until 13 December 1981, when General Jaruzelski declared martial law in Poland.[2] Wałęsa and many other Solidarity leaders and activists were arrested; he was incarcerated for 11 months until 14 November 1982 at Chylice, Otwock, and Arłamów; eastern towns near the Soviet border.[10][12] On 8 October 1982, Solidarity was outlawed.[17] In 1983, Wałęsa applied to return to the Gdańsk Shipyard as an electrician.[10] The same year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[2] He was unable to accept it himself, fearing Poland\\'s government would not let him back into the country.[2][10] His wife Danuta accepted the prize on his behalf.[2][10]\\nThrough the mid-1980s, Wałęsa continued underground Solidarity-related activities.[18] Every issue of the leading underground weekly publication Tygodnik Mazowsze bore his motto, \"Solidarity will not be divided or destroyed\".[19] Following a 1986 amnesty for Solidarity activists,[20] Wałęsa co-founded the Provisional Council of NSZZ Solidarity (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność), the first overt legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law.[18] From 1987 to 1990, he organized and led the semi-illegal Provisional Executive Committee of the Solidarity Trade Union. In mid-1988, he instigated work-stoppage strikes at the Gdańsk Shipyard.[18] He was frequently hauled in for interrogations by the Polish secret police, the Security Service, during the 1980s. On many of these occasions, Danuta—who was even more anti-Communist than her husband—was known to openly taunt Security Service agents when they picked Lech up.[21]\\nAfter months of strikes and political deliberations, at the conclusion of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers\\' Party (PZPR, the Polish Communist party), the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989.[2] Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations.[12] During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations.[2] At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.[2][14][22][23]\\nIn December 1988, Wałęsa co-founded the Solidarity Citizens\\' Committee;[12] this was ostensibly an advisory body but in practice a political party that won the parliamentary elections in June 1989. Solidarity took all the seats in the Sejm that were subject to free elections, and all but one seat in the newly re-established Senate.[24] Wałęsa was one of Solidarity\\'s most public figures; he was an active campaigner, appearing on many campaign posters, but did not run for parliament himself.[2] Solidarity winners in the Sejm elections were referred to as \"Wałęsa\\'s team\" or \"Lech\\'s team\" because they had all appeared on their election posters with Wałęsa.[25][26]\\nWhile ostensibly only chairman of Solidarity, Wałęsa played a key role in practical politics. In August 1989, he persuaded leaders of parties formerly allied with the Communist party to form a non-Communist coalition government—the first non-Communist government in the Soviet Bloc. The parliament elected Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the first non-Communist Prime Minister of Poland in over forty years.[14]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nPresident Bush meets privately with Wałęsa, November 1989.\\nFollowing the June 1989 parliamentary elections, Wałęsa was disappointed that some of his former fellow campaigners were satisfied to govern alongside former Communists.[14] He decided to run for the newly re-established office of president, using the slogan, \"I don\\'t want to, but I have to\" (\"Nie chcę, ale muszę.\").[2][14] On 9 December 1990, Wałęsa won the presidential election, defeating Prime Minister Mazowiecki and other candidates to become Poland\\'s first freely elected head of state in 63 years, and the first non-Communist head of state in 45 years.[10] In 1993, he founded his own political party, the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (BBWR); the grouping\\'s Polish-language acronym echoed that of Józef Piłsudski\\'s \"Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government,\" of 1928–35, likewise an ostensibly non-political organization.[27]\\nDuring his presidency, Wałęsa saw Poland through privatization and transition to a free-market economy (the Balcerowicz Plan), Poland\\'s 1991 first completely free parliamentary elections, and a period of redefinition of the country\\'s foreign relations.[2][11] He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts.[10] Wałęsa supported Poland\\'s entry into NATO and the European Union, both of which occurred after his presidency, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.[10] In the early 1990s, he proposed the creation of a sub-regional security system called NATO bis. The concept was supported by right-wing and populist movements in Poland but garnered little support abroad; Poland\\'s neighbors, some of which (e.g. Lithuania), had recently regained independence and tended to see the proposal as Polish neo-imperialism.[14][28]\\nWałęsa has been criticized for a confrontational style and for instigating \"war at the top\", whereby former Solidarity allies clashed with one another, causing annual changes of government.[11][14][19][29][30] This increasingly isolated Wałęsa on the political scene.[31] As he lost political allies, he came to be surrounded by people who were viewed by the public as incompetent and disreputable.[19][31] Mudslinging during election campaigns tarnished his reputation.[2][32] Some thought Wałęsa, an ex-electrician with no higher education, was too plain-spoken and too undignified for the post of president.[11][14][33] Others thought him too erratic in his views[14][30][34] or complained he was too authoritarian and that he sought to strengthen his own power at the expense of the Sejm.[14][30][31][33] Wałęsa\\'s national security advisor Jacek Merkel credited the shortcomings of Wałęsa\\'s presidency to his inability to comprehend the office of the president as an institution. He was an effective union leader capable of articulating what the workers felt but as president he had difficulty delegating power or navigating bureaucracy.[35][clarification needed] Wałęsa\\'s problems were compounded by the difficult transition to a market economy; in the long run it was seen as highly successful but it lost Wałęsa\\'s government much popular support.[30][31][36]\\nWałęsa\\'s BBWR performed poorly in the 1993 parliamentary elections; at times his popular support dwindled to 10 percent and he narrowly lost the 1995 presidential election, winning 33.11 percent of the vote in the first round and 48.28 percent in the run-off against Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who represented the resurgent Polish post-Communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).[2][14][31] Wałęsa\\'s fate was sealed by his poor handling of the media; in televised debates he appeared incoherent and rude; in response to Kwaśniewski\\'s extended hand at the end of the first of the two debates, he replied that the post-Communist leader could \"shake his leg\".[31] After the election, Wałęsa said he was going into \"political retirement\" and his role in politics became increasingly marginal.[29][37][38]\\n\\nPost-presidency[edit]\\nWałęsa giving a speech at the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan in 1996\\nAfter losing the 1995 election, Wałęsa announced he would return to work as an electrician at the Gdańsk Shipyard.[39] Soon afterwards, he changed his mind and chose to travel around the world on a lecture circuit.[40] Wałęsa developed a portfolio of three lectures (\"The Impact of an Expanded NATO on Global Security\", \"Democracy: The Never-Ending Battle\" and \"Solidarity: The New Millennium\"), and reads them at universities and public events with an appearance fee of around £50,000 ($70,000).[41][42][43]\\nIn 1995, he founded the Lech Wałęsa Institute[44], a think tank with a mission \"to popularize the achievements of Polish Solidarity, educate young generations, promote democracy, and build civil society in Poland and around the world\".[44][45] In 1997, he founded a new party, Christian Democracy of the Third Polish Republic, hoping it would help him to successfully run in future elections.[46] Wałęsa\\'s contention for the 2000 presidential election ended with a crushing defeat when he polled 1.01 percent of the vote.[47][48] His humiliation was increased because Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was re-elected in the first round with 54 percent of the vote, is a former Communist apparatchik.[47] Wałęsa polled in seventh place,[47] after which he announced his withdrawal from Polish politics.[49]\\nIn 2006, Wałęsa quit Solidarity in protest of the union\\'s support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin brothers who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country\\'s president and prime minister, respectively.[50] The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis\\' focus on rooting out those who had been involved in Communist rule and their party\\'s attempt to make public all the files of the former Communist secret police.[50] Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services.[51] Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the Communist secret police could face exposure.[51]\\n\\nWałęsa speaks at a tourism trade fair in Berlin, 2011.\\nWałęsa speaks on VIII European Economic Forum, 2015.\\nPolitical views[edit]\\nIn 2011, Wałęsa rejected Lithuania\\'s Order of Vytautas the Great as a result of constant discrimination on the part of the Lithuanian government towards its Polish minority.[52] Wałęsa was well known for his conservative stance on LGBT rights. In 2013, he said on Polish television that \"he doesn\\'t wish for this minority, which he tolerates and understands, to impose itself on the majority\".[53]\\nReferring to Robert Biedroń, he argued that, considering that as they represent less than one percent of the Polish society, proportionally speaking, homosexual MPs should sit \"in the last row of the parliament, or even behind its walls\". After sharp international criticism, including City authorities of San Francisco\\'s decision to rename Walesa Street as a result of those remarks, Wałęsa apologized for his comments, stressing that \"being a man of old date, in his view one\\'s sexual orientation should lie in one\\'s intimate sphere\".[54][55] He said that \"his intentions were distorted by the media\" and \"homosexuality should be respected\".[56] Over the following years, Wałęsa\\'s views shifted, and he has voiced his support for the introduction of same-sex marriage in Poland and has repeatedly met with Biedroń, whom he called \"a talent\" and \"a future president of Poland\".[57][58][59]\\nIn 2013, Wałęsa suggested the creation of a political union between Poland and Germany.[60] In 2014, in a widely publicized interview, Wałęsa expressed his disappointment in another Nobel laureate, US president Barack Obama: he told CNN, \"When he was elected there was great hope in the world. We were hoping that Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America, but that failed\\xa0...\\xa0 in terms of politics and morality America no longer leads the world\".[61] Wałęsa also accused Obama of not deserving his Nobel Peace Prize;[62] during the 2012 US presidential campaign he endorsed Obama\\'s opponent Mitt Romney.[63]\\nIn September 2015, Wałęsa, referring to the migrant crisis in Europe, said: \"watching the refugees on television, I noticed that\\xa0...\\xa0they are well fed, well dressed and maybe even are richer than we are\\xa0...\\xa0If Europe opens its gates, soon millions will come through and while living among us will start exercising their own customs, including beheading\".[62] In August 2017, ten Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including Wałęsa, urged Saudi Arabia to stop the executions of 14 young people for participating in the 2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests.[64]\\n\\nWałęsa and secret police[edit]\\nDespite the 2000 ruling of a special lustration court affirming his innocence, for many years there have been allegations that Wałęsa was an informant of the Security Service of the Polish People\\'s Republic (Służba Bezpieczeństwa or SB), the Communist security services, in his twenties.[65] In his 2002 book titled The Polish Revolution: Solidarity, British historian Timothy Garton Ash writes that Wałęsa, while vehemently denying being a regular Security Service informer, admitted that he had \"signed something\" under interrogation in the 1970s.[66]:\\u200a378\\u200a In 2008, a book written by historians Sławomir Cenckiewicz and Piotr Gontarczyk titled SB a Lech Wałęsa. Przyczynek do biografii (SB and Lech Wałęsa. Contribution to biography) purported to show that Wałęsa, codenamed Bolek, had been an operative for the security services from 1970 to 1976.[50]\\nThe issue of Wałęsa\\'s alleged collaboration with the communist regime resurfaced again in February 2016, when the Institute of National Remembrance seized materials from the widow of Czesław Kiszczak, former minister of the Minister of Interior, that were said to document Wałęsa\\'s role as a spy for the security services.[50] In 2017, a handwriting study ordered by the government-controlled Institute of National Remembrance (INR), stated that signatures on several documents from the 1970s belonged to Wałęsa.[67] The exact nature of Wałęsa\\'s relationship with Security Service continues to be a source of scholarly debate among historians.[68][69]\\n\\n2000 Lustration Court ruling[edit]\\nOn 12 August 2000, Wałęsa, who was running a presidential campaign at the time, was cleared by the special Lustration Court of charges that he collaborated with the Communist-era secret services and reported on the activities of his fellow shipyard workers, due to the lack of evidence.[70] Anti-Communists Piotr Naimski, one of the first members of the Workers\\' Defense Committee that led to the Solidarity trade union, and Antoni Macierewicz, Wałęsa\\'s former Interior Minister, testified against him in the closed vetting trial. Naimski, who said he testified with a \"heavy heart\", expressed his disappointment that Wałęsa \"made a mistake by not going openly to the public, and he has missed an important chance\".[70] According to Naimski, the court cleared Wałęsa on \"technical grounds\" because it did not find certain original documents—many of which had been destroyed since 1989—that offered sufficient proof that Wałęsa was lying.[70]\\nIn 1992, Naimski, as a head of the State Protection Office, started the process of screening people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland.[70] In June that year, he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members of the government and parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president.[70] Wałęsa\\'s name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion.[70] In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz.[71] A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.[70]\\nA 1997 Polish law made vetting a requirement for those seeking high public office. According to the law, it is not a crime to have collaborated, but those who deny it and are found to have lied are banned from political life for ten years. The 2000 presidential election was the first use of this law.[70] Despite helping Wałęsa in 2005 to receive the official status of a \"victim of communist regime\" from the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN),[72] this court ruling did not convince many Poles.[70] In November 2009, Wałęsa sued the president of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, over his repeated collaboration allegations.[73] Five months later, Kaczyński failed to invite Wałęsa to the commemoration service at Katyn, which almost certainly saved Wałęsa\\'s life because the presidential plane crashed, killing all on board.[74] In August 2010, Wałęsa lost a libel case against Krzysztof Wyszkowski, his former fellow activist, who also publicly accused Wałęsa of being a Communist agent in 1970s.[75][76]\\n\\nSB and Lech Wałęsa. A contribution to biography (2008)[edit]\\nThe most comprehensive analysis of Wałęsa\\'s possible collaboration with secret police was provided in a 2008 book SB a Lech Wałęsa. Przyczynek do biografii\\xa0[pl] (SB and Lech Wałęsa. Contribution to biography).[77] The book was written by two historians from the Institute of National Remembrance, Sławomir Cenckiewicz and Piotr Gontarczyk, and included documents from the archives of the secret police that were inherited by the institute.[78] Among the documents were registration cards, memos, notes from the secret police, and reports from the informant.[79][80]\\nThe book\\'s authors argue that Wałęsa, working under the code name Bolek,[e] was a secret police informant from 1970 (after being released from jail) until 1976 (before he was fired from the shipyard).[81] According to the authors, \"he wrote reports and informed on more than 20 people and some of them were persecuted by the Communist police. He identified people and eavesdropped on his colleagues at work while they were listening to Radio Free Europe for example\".[82] The book describes the fate of seven of his alleged victims; information regarding others was destroyed or stolen from the files.[78] According to them, Wałęsa received over 13,000 zlotys as remuneration for his services from the Security Service, while the monthly salary at the time was about 3,500 zlotys.[f][84][85] The authors said oppositionist activity in Poland in the first half of 1970s was minimal and Wałęsa\\'s role in it was quite marginal.[80] However, according to the book, despite formally renouncing his ties with Security Service in 1976, Wałęsa went on to have contacts with Communist officials.[86]\\nThe authors also claim that during his 1990–1995 presidency, Wałęsa used his office to destroy the evidence of his collaboration with the secret police by removing incriminating documents from the archives.[80] According to the book, historians discovered that with the help of the state intelligence agency, Wałęsa, Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski, and other members of Wałęsa\\'s administration had borrowed from the archives the secret police files that had connections to Wałęsa, and returned them with key pages removed.[78][84] When it was discovered at the turn of 1995/96, the following prosecutorial inquiry was discontinued for political reasons despite the case attracting much public attention.[75][84]\\nSławomir Cenckiewicz also said that in 1983, when Wałęsa was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa\\'s previous collaboration with the government. By this time though, Wałęsa was already so popular that most Poles did not believe the official media and dismissed the allegations as a manipulation by the Communist authorities.[78] The book\\'s first print run sold out in Poland within hours.[87][88] The book received substantial coverage in the media, provoked nationwide debate, and was noted by the international press.[89][90][91] Wałęsa vowed to sue the authors but never did.[88]\\n\\nKiszczak archives[edit]\\nOn 18 February 2016, the government-affiliated INR in Warsaw announced it had seized a package of original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Security Service informant.[92][67] The documents dated from the period 1970–1976; they were seized from the home of a recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak.[93] The documents\\' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert,[93][94] but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination.[95] Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were authentic, which suggest he was a paid informant.[67] Wałęsa previously said that he had signed a commitment to inform document, but that he had never acted on it.[67]\\n\\nSignature Lech Wałęsa-Bolek on the collaboration agreement with Security Service from the Kiszczak archives\\nThe dossier consists of two folders. The first is a \"personal file\" containing 90 pages of documents, including a handwritten commitment to cooperate with Polish Security Service dated 21 December 1970,[96] and signed Lech Wałęsa – Bolek with a pledge he would never admit his collaboration with secret police \"not even to family\";[97] the file also contains the confirmations of having received funds.[92][93] The second is a \"work file\" which contains 279 pages of documents, including numerous reports by Bolek on his co-workers at Gdańsk Shipyard, and notes by Security Service officers from meetings with him.[92][93] According to one note, Wałęsa agreed to collaborate out of fear of persecution after the workers\\' protest in 1970.[96] The documents also show that at first Bolek eagerly provided information on the opinions and actions of his co-workers and took money for the information, but his enthusiasm diminished and the quality of his information decreased until he was deemed no longer valuable and collaboration with him was terminated in 1976.[96]\\nThe sealed dossier also contained a letter, hand-written by Kiszczak in April 1996, in which he informs the Director of the Polish Central Archives of Modern Records (Archiwum Akt Nowych) about the accompanying files documenting the collaboration of Wałęsa with the Polish Security Service and asks him not to publish this information until five years after Wałęsa\\'s death.[97] In his letter, Kiszczak said he kept the documents out of reach: before the 1989 revolution, trying to protect Wałęsa\\'s reputation; and afterwards to make sure they did not disappear or were used for political reasons.[97] This letter and the accompanying documents had never been sent.[93]\\nOn 16 February 2016, about three months after Kiszczak\\'s death, his widow Maria approached the Institute of National Remembrance and offered to sell the documents to the archives for 90,000 zlotys ($23,000).[98] However, according to Polish law, all documents of the political police must be handed in to the state.[98] The administration of the institute notified the prosecutor\\'s office, which conducted a police search of the Kiszczaks\\' house and seized all the historic documents.[98] Maria Kiszczak later said she had not read her husband\\'s letter and had \"made a mistake\".[99]\\n\\nWałęsa\\'s response[edit]\\nFor years, Wałęsa vehemently denied collaborating with the Polish Security Service and dismissed the incriminating files as forgeries created by the Security Service to compromise him.[100] Wałęsa also denies that during his presidency he removed documents incriminating him from the archives.[84] Until 2008, he denied having ever seen his Security Service file.[84] After the publication of the book SB a Lech Wałęsa in 2008, he said that while he was president \"I did borrow the file, but didn\\'t remove anything from it. I saw there were some documents there about me and that they were clearly forgeries. I told my secretaries to tape up and seal the file. I wrote \\'don\\'t open\\' on it. But someone didn\\'t obey, removed the papers, now casting suspicion on me.\"[84][85] Wałęsa\\'s interior minister Andrzej Milczanowski denied the cover-up and said he \"had full legal rights to make those documents available to President Wałęsa\" and that \"no original documents were removed from the file\", which contained only photocopies.[84]\\nWałęsa has offered conflicting statements regarding the authenticity of the documents.[97] Initially he appeared to come close to an admission, saying in 1992, \"in December 1970, I signed three or four documents\"[75][101] to escape from the secret police.[97] In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope,[102] Wałęsa said, \"It is also the truth that I had not left that clash completely pure. They gave me a condition: sign! And then I signed.\"[75] He denied he acted upon the collaboration agreement.[103] However, in his later years Wałęsa said all the documents are forgeries and told the BBC in 2008, \"you will not find any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere\".[82][92]\\nIn 2009, after the publication of another biography connecting him with the secret police (Lech Wałęsa: Idea and History by Pawel Zyzak),[104] Wałęsa threatened to leave Poland if historians continue to question his past.[105][106] He said that before revealing such information \"a historian must decide whether this serves Poland\".[105] After the accusations against him resurfaced with the discovery of the Kiszczak dossier on 16 February 2016, Wałęsa called the files \"lies, slander and forgeries\",[107] and said he \"never took money and never made any spoken or written report on anyone\".[108] He said of the Polish public, which was about to believe in the allegations, \"you have betrayed me, not me you\",[99] and \"it was I who safely led Poland to a complete victory over communism\".[107] On 20 February 2016, Wałęsa wrote in his blog that a secret police officer had begged him to sign the financial documents in the 1970s because the officer had lost money entrusted to him to purchase a vehicle. Wałęsa appealed to the officer to step forward and clear him of the accusations.[109][110]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nOn 8 November 1969, Wałęsa married Mirosława Danuta Gołoś, who worked at a flower shop near the Lenin Shipyard where Wałęsa worked. Soon after they married, she began using her middle name more often than her first name, per Lech\\'s request.[111] The couple had eight children; Bogdan (born 1970), Sławomir (born 1972), Przemysław[112] (1974–2017), Jarosław (born 1976), Magdalena (born 1979), Anna (born 1980), Maria-Wiktoria (born 1982), and Brygida (born 1985).[10][12] As of 2016[update], Anna is running her father\\'s office in Gdańsk[62] and Jarosław is a European MP.[113]\\nIn 2008, Wałęsa underwent a coronary artery stent placement and the implantation of a cardiac pacemaker at the Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas.[114] He underwent a heart operation in 2021.[115] In January 2022, Wałęsa tested positive for COVID-19. He said he had received three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[115]\\n\\nHonors[edit]\\nMain article: List of awards and honors received by Lech Wałęsa\\nWałęsa receiving the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award, 2011\\nIn 1983, Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[116] Since then, he has received more than 30 state decorations and more than 50 awards from 30 countries, including Order of the Bath (UK), Order of Merit (Germany), Legion of Honour (France) and European Human Rights Prize (EU 1989).[12] In 2011, he declined to accept the Lithuanian highest order, citing his displeasure at Lithuania\\'s policy towards the Polish diaspora.[117] In 2008, he established the Lech Wałęsa Award.\\xa0[pl][45]\\nIn 2004, Gdańsk International Airport was officially renamed Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport and Wałęsa\\'s signature was incorporated into the airport\\'s logo.[118][119] A college hall in Northeastern Illinois University (Chicago),[120] six streets, and five schools in Canada, France, Sweden and Poland also were named after Lech Wałęsa\\nWałęsa was named Man of the Year by Time magazine (1981),[121] Financial Times (1980), Saudi Gazette (1989) and 12 other newspapers and magazines.[12] He was awarded with over 45 honorary doctorates by universities around the world,[45] including Harvard University and Sorbonne.[116] He was named an honorary karate black belt by International Traditional Karate Federation.[122] Wałęsa is also an honorary citizen of more than 30 cities, including London, Buffalo and Turin.[45]\\nIn the United States, Wałęsa was the first recipient of the Liberty Medal, in 1989.[123] That year, he also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom[124] and became the first non-head-of-state to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.[125] In 2000, Wałęsa received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[126] Wałęsa symbolically represented Europe by carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics.[127] In 2004, he represented ten newly acceded EU countries during the official accession ceremony in Strasbourg.[45] In 1993, the heraldic authority of the Kingdom of Sweden assigned Wałęsa a personal coat of arms on the occasion of his admittance into the Royal Order of the Seraphim.[citation needed]\\n\\nCultural references[edit]\\nWałęsa has been portrayed, as himself or a character based on him, in a number of feature and television films. The two most notable of them are:\\n\\nWalesa: Man of Hope (2013) is a biographical drama by Oscar-winning filmmaker Andrzej Wajda about the lives of Wałęsa (Robert Więckiewicz) and his wife Danuta (Agnieszka Grochowska) from 1970 to 1989. It shows Wałęsa\\'s change from a shipyard worker into a charismatic labor leader. The film was shot in the historical locations of the depicted events, including the former Lenin Shipyard. It won three awards, including Silver Hugo for Robert Więckiewicz at Chicago International Film Festival and a Pasinetti Award for Maria Rosaria Omaggio at Venice Film Festival, and was nominated for five more awards.[128]\\nMan of Iron (1981) is another Andrzej Wajda film about the Solidarity movement. The main character, a young worker Maciej Tomczyk (Jerzy Radziwiłowicz) is involved in the anti-Communist labor movement. Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wałęsa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the Palme d\\'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival for the film. In 1982, it was nominated for Oscar as the Best Foreign Language Film and gained seven other awards and nominations.[129]\\nPremiere of Walesa. Man of Hope in Warsaw, 2013\\nBoth of these films were produced in Poland. In December 1989, Warner Bros. intended to produce a \"major\" movie about Wałęsa, to be made in 1990 and released in 1991.[130] The company paid Wałęsa a $1 million fee for the rights to produce a biopic.[131] Although the movie was never made, this payment sparked controversy in Poland when five years later it emerged that Wałęsa concealed this income to avoid paying taxes on it.[132] The Gdańsk tax office initiated a tax fraud case against Wałęsa but it was later dismissed because the five-year statute of limitations had already run out.[133]\\n\\nPolish actor Jacek Lenartowicz\\xa0[pl] played Walesa in the 2005 television miniseries Pope John Paul II.[134]\\nIn 1982, Bono was inspired by Wałęsa to write U2\\'s first hit single, \"New Year\\'s Day\".[135] Coincidentally, the Polish authorities lifted martial law on 1 January 1983, the same day this single was released. Wałęsa also became a hero of a number of Polish pop songs, including a satirical 1991 hit titled Nie wierzcie elektrykom (Don\\'t Trust the Electricians) from the second studio album by the punk rock band Big Cyc which featured a caricature of Wałęsa on its cover.[136]\\nPatrick Dailly\\'s chamber opera Solidarity, starring Kristen Brown as Wałęsa, was premiered by the San Francisco Cabaret Opera in Berkeley, California, in September 2009.[137]\\nSid Meier\\'s Civilization V video game lists Lech Wałęsa amongst its world leader rankings. Wałęsa is ranked 11th on a scale of 1 to 21, with Augustus Caesar ranked as the best world leader of all time and Dan Quayle as the worst. Wałęsa is immediately outranked by Simon Bolivar and is ranked just above Ivan the Terrible. Lech Wałęsa ranks 9th out of 21 in Sid Meier\\'s Civilization VI, immediately outranked by Marcus Aurelius and ranked just above Hatshepsut.[citation needed]\\n\\nPublications[edit]\\nWałęsa, Lech (1987).

He served as the president of Poland from 1995 to 2005.[1] His tenure as President was marked by modernization of Poland, rapid economic growth (Poland\\'s GDP has doubled in ten years), the drafting of a new Polish Constitution (1997), and the accession of Poland to NATO (1999) and the European Union (2004).[2] [3] In 2004, he brokered a pro-democratic agreement during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.[4][5]\\nHe was born in Białogard, attended the University of Gdańsk, and served as the Minister of Sport in the communist government during the 1980s. After the fall of Communism, he became a leader of the centre-left Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, a successor to the former ruling Polish United Workers\\' Party, and a co-founder of the Democratic Left Alliance.\\nKwaśniewski was elected to the presidency in 1995, defeating the incumbent, Lech Wałęsa. He was re-elected to a second and final term as President in 2000 in a decisive first-round victory. In line with a constitutional limit of two terms, his second term ended on 23 December 2005. According to a 2020 poll conducted by Rzeczpospolita, Kwaśniewski was considered the best president in post-1989 history of Poland.[6]\\n\\n\\nEarly political career (1973–1995)[edit]\\nFrom 1973 to 1977, Kwaśniewski studied Transport Economics and Foreign Trade at the University of Gdańsk, although he never graduated.[7] He became politically active at this time, and joined the ruling Polish United Workers\\' Party (PZPR) in 1977, remaining a member until it was dissolved in 1990.[8]\\nAn activist in the communist student movement until 1982, he held, among other positions, the chairmanship of the University Council of the Socialist Union of Polish Students (SZSP) from 1976 to 1977 and the vice-chairmanship of the Gdańsk Voivodship Union from 1977 to 1979. Kwaśniewski was a member of the SZSP supreme authorities from 1977 to 1982.[9]\\n\\nKwaśniewski (left) on Andrzej Tadeusz Kijowski\\'s talk show in December 1994\\nFrom November 1981 to February 1984 he was the editor-in-chief of the communist-controlled student weekly ITD, then editor-in-chief of the daily communist youth Sztandar Młodych from 1984 to 1985. He was a co-founder of the first computer-science periodical in Poland, Bajtek, in 1985. From 1985 to 1987, Kwaśniewski was Minister for Youth Affairs in the Zbigniew Messner government, and then Chairman of the Committee for Youth and Physical Culture till 1990.[10]\\nHe joined the government of Mieczysław Rakowski, first as a Cabinet Minister and then as chairman of the government Social-Political Committee from October 1988 to September 1989. A participant in the Round-Table negotiations, he co-chaired the task group for trade-union pluralism with Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Romuald Sosnowski.[11]\\nAs the PZPR was wound up, he became a founding member of the post-communist Social Democratic Party of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) from January to February 1990, and its first chairman until he assumed the presidency in December 1995. He was also one of the founding members of the coalition Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in 1991.[12]\\nKwaśniewski was an activist in the Student Sports Union from 1975 to 1979 and the Polish Olympic Committee (PKOL); he later served as PKOL president from 1988 to 1991. Running for the Sejm from the Warsaw constituency in 1991, he won the largest number of votes (148,533), although did not win an absolute majority. Kwaśniewski headed the parliamentary caucus of the Democratic Left Alliance in his first and second terms (1991–1995).[13]\\nHe was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly from November 1993 to November 1995.[14]\\n\\nPresidency (1995–2005)[edit]\\nKwaśniewski receiving praises by supporters after his presidential victory in 1995\\nIn an often bitter campaign, Kwaśniewski won the presidential election in 1995, collecting 51.7 percent of votes in the run-off, against 48.3 percent for the incumbent, Lech Wałęsa, the former Solidarity leader. Kwaśniewski\\'s campaign slogans were \"Let\\'s choose the future\" (Wybierzmy przyszłość) and \"A Poland for all\" (Wspólna Polska).[15]\\nPolitical opponents disputed his victory and produced evidence to show that he had lied about his education in registration documents and public presentations. There was also some mystery over his graduation from university. A law court confirmed that Kwaśniewski had lied about his record—and this did not come to light until after the election—but did not penalise him for it. Kwaśniewski took the presidential oath of office on 23 December 1995. Later the same day, he was sworn in as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces at the Warszawa First Fighter Wing, in Mińsk Mazowiecki.[16]\\nHis political course resembled that of Wałęsa\\'s in several key respects, such as the pursuit of closer ties to the European Union and NATO. Kwaśniewski also continued the transition to a market economy and the privatization of state-owned enterprises, although with less energy than his predecessor.\\nHoping to be seen as \"the president of all Poles\", including his political opponents, he resigned from the SLD after the election. Every Polish president since then has renounced formal ties with their party upon taking office. Later, he formed a coalition with the rightist government of Jerzy Buzek with few major conflicts and on several occasions, he stood against movements of the SLD government of Leszek Miller. At one moment, support for Kwaśniewski reached as high as 80% in popularity polls; most of the time it was over 50%.[citation needed]\\nIn 1997, the Polish newspaper Zycie reported that Kwaśniewski had met former KGB officer Vladimir Alganov at the Baltic sea resort Cetniewo in 1994. First Kwaśniewski denied ever meeting Alganov and filed a libel suit against the newspaper. Eventually, Kwaśniewski admitted that he had met Alganov on official occasions, but denied meeting him in Cetniewo.[17]\\nKwaśniewski\\'s greatest achievement was his ability to bring about a new Constitution of Poland to replace the modified Stalinist document then still in use. The failure to create a new document had been a criticism often levelled at Wałęsa. Kwaśniewski actively campaigned for its approval in the subsequent referendum, and he signed it into law on 16 July 1997. He took an active part in the efforts to secure Polish membership of NATO.[18]\\n\\nKwaśniewski with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, October 2001\\nHe headed Poland\\'s delegation at the 1997 Madrid summit, where Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were promised membership; and the Washington summit, where on 26 February 1999, during the Kosovo conflict, which he supported, he signed the instruments ratifying Poland\\'s membership of NATO. He also took an active part in promoting further enlargement of the alliance, speaking out in favor of membership for a further seven states and the open-door policy that leaves open the option of further members.[19]\\nHe was an author of the 2002 Riga Initiative, a forum for cooperation between Central European states, aimed towards further enlargement of NATO and the European Union.[20]\\nAn advocate of regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe, Kwaśniewski hosted a summit of the region\\'s leaders at Łańcut in 1996. Speaking out against the danger organized crime posed to the region, he submitted a draft of a convention on fighting organised crime to the UN in 1996. He was an active participant at meetings of regional leaders in Portorož in 1997, Levoča in 1998, and Lviv and Yalta in 1999.\\n\\nKwaśniewski with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende in Warsaw, October 2003\\nAfter a history of sometimes acrimonious relations with Lithuania, Kwaśniewski was a driving force behind the presidential summit in Vilnius in 1997, at which the two countries\\' presidents signed a treaty of friendship. Poland subsequently became one of the strongest advocates of Lithuanian membership in NATO and the European Union and the strongest advocate of Ukraine in Europe. In 2000 he was re-elected in a single round, collecting 53.9 percent of the vote. His election campaign slogan was: \"A home for all—Poland\" (Dom wszystkich—Polska). [21] To date, this is the only time since the end of Communism that a presidential election has been decided in a single round.\\nFollowing the 11 September 2001 attacks, Kwaśniewski organized an international conference in Warsaw, with the participation of leaders from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe to strengthen regional activities in fighting international terrorism. Under Kwaśniewski\\'s leadership, Poland became a strong ally of the United States in the War on Terror and contributed troops in the Iraq War, a move that was highly controversial in Poland and Europe.[22]\\nPoland was in charge of a sector of Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein. Polish membership of the European Union became a reality on 1 May 2004, during Kwaśniewski\\'s second term.[23] Both he and his wife Jolanta had campaigned for approval of the EU accession treaty in June 2003. He strongly supported including mention of Europe\\'s Christian roots into the European Constitution.[24][25] Thanks to his close relations with Leonid Kuchma, in late 2004 he became a mediator in a political conflict in Ukraine – the Orange Revolution, and according to some commentators, he played the major role in its peaceful solution.[26]\\n\\nKwaśniewski with U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington, D.C., October 2005\\nAfter the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, Kwaśniewski admitted that he had agreed in 2003 to host a secret CIA black site in Poland, but that activities were to be carried out in accordance to Polish law. He said that a U.S. draft memorandum had stated that \"people held in Poland are to be treated as prisoners of war and will be afforded all the rights they are entitled to\", but due to time constraints, the U.S. had not signed the memorandum. The U.S. had conducted activities in great secrecy at the site.[27]\\n\\nControversial pardons[edit]\\nIn December 2005, when his presidency was coming to an end, he granted clemency for a post-Communist deputy minister of Justice Zbigniew Sobotka, who had been sentenced for 3.5 years of prison for revealing a state secret (effectively, he warned gangsters about an operation against them). Kwaśniewski changed the prison sentence to probation.[28][29][30]\\nAnother case of Kwaśniewski\\'s controversial granting of pardons was the Peter Vogel case. The story goes back to 1971 when Piotr Filipczyński, a.k.a. Peter Vogel was sentenced to 25 years in jail for a brutal murder (shortened to 15 years in 1979). Surprisingly enough, in 1983 (during martial law in Poland) he was granted a passport and allowed to leave the country. He returned in 1990 soon earning the nickname \"the accountant of the Left\" as a former Swiss banker who took care of more than thirty accounts of Polish social democrats. Despite an arrest warrant issued in 1987, Vogel moved freely in Poland and was eventually arrested in 1998 in Switzerland. After Vogel\\'s extradition to Poland, in 1999 Kwaśniewski initiated the procedure of granting him amnesty. In December 2005 (a few days before leaving his office) Kwaśniewski pardoned Vogel despite the negative opinion of the procurer.[31][32]\\n\\nRywingate[edit]\\nKwaśniewski refused in 2003 to face a special parliamentary commission,[33][34] which was set up to reveal all circumstances linked with Rywingate. Kwaśniewski argued, that the constitution did not allow parliamentary commissions to investigate the president, and there were no clear law opinions. The commission decided eventually not to summon Kwaśniewski.[35]\\nFor a second time Kwaśniewski refused as a witness to face the commission investigating the privatization of Orlen petrol concern, in March 2005. He argued that the actions of commission members, being in opposition to the leftist government supported by him, were directed against him.[36] He sought to undermine the commission by releasing considerable amounts of information to journalists while only belatedly making it available to the commission members.[citation needed]\\n\\nMember of secret police allegations[edit]\\nIn 2007, IPN revealed that Kwaśniewski was registered during communist times as an agent \"Alek\" of the secret police, the Security Service (Służba Bezpieczeństwa – SB), from 1983 to 1989. Kwaśniewski himself denied having been an agent in a special statement, demanded from politicians by Polish law, and a court confirmed his statement.[37]\\n\\nPost-presidency[edit]\\nOn 7 March 2006, Kwaśniewski was appointed Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership at Georgetown University, where he teaches students in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service about contemporary European politics, the trans-Atlantic relationship, and democratization in Central and Eastern Europe. He also teaches a course on political leadership, convened by Professor Carol Lancaster, with former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar.[38] He is also Chairman of the supervisory board of the International Centre for Policy Studies in Kiev, Ukraine and a member of the International Honorary Council[39] of the European Academy of Diplomacy.\\nIn 2008 Aleksander Kwaśniewski became Chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit organization established to monitor tolerance in Europe, prepare practical recommendations to governments and international organisations on improving interreligious and interethnic relations on the continent. The organization is co-chaired by European Jewish Fund President Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor.\\nSince June 2012 Kwaśniewski and Pat Cox lead a European Parliament monitoring mission in Ukraine to monitor the criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko and Valeriy Ivaschenko.[40]\\nSince 2011, Kwaśniewski has served on the Leadership Council for Concordia, a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future.\\nKwaśniewski was also involved with the EU talks with the Ukrainian government about the association agreement with the EU that the Ukrainian parliament failed to ratify in November 2013.[41] After the Maidan unrest had installed the transitional government under Yatsenyuk, who signed the EU association agreement for Ukraine in 2014, Kwaśniewski took up in a director\\'s post in the gas company ″Burisma Holdings Limited″ which owns licenses for the major Ukrainian gas fields.[42][43]\\nIn 2019, he became a Member of the International Advisory Council (IAC) to Uzbekistan. In 2020, he assumed the position of Chair of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Commission on Drugs.[44]\\n\\nPossible illegal lobbying on behalf of Paul Manafort[edit]\\nIn a plea agreement filed in United States Federal court on 14 September 2018, former Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort admitted to organizing a group of former European heads of state to illegally lobby, starting in 2011, on behalf of then-Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. The plea agreement describes one of the heads of state involved in this secret lobbying as a \"former Polish President\" who \"was also a representative of the European Parliament with oversight responsibility for Ukraine.\"[45] At least one press report claimed that Kwaśniewski was this former Polish President.[46]\\n\\nAwards[edit]\\nAleksander Kwaśniewski during the 2013 European Economic Forum\\nPresident Kwaśniewski greets President of the U.S. George W.

Before his tenure as president, he previously served as President of the Supreme Audit Office from 1992 to 1995 and later Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General in Jerzy Buzek\\'s cabinet from 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001.\\nBorn in Warsaw, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, The Two Who Stole the Moon, with his identical twin brother Jarosław. Kaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980, he was awarded his Ph.D. by Gdańsk University. In 1990, he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.\\nDuring the communist period, Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers\\' Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an \"anti-socialist element\". After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity. When Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Solidarity Citizens\\' Committee in 1988.\\nFrom February to April 1989, he participated in the Polish Round Table Talks along with his brother. After Solidarity\\'s victory in the 1989 Polish legislative election, Kaczyński became a senator and vice-chairman of the movement. Then in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, he was elected into the Sejm as a non-party member. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski\\'s government. In 2001, Kaczyński co-founded the Law and Justice party, after splitting from the Solidarity Electoral Action and the Christian National Union, along with his brother.[1][2] Kaczyński was the party\\'s presidential candidate, during the 2005 Polish presidential election. In the first round of voting, Kaczyński received 33.1% of the valid votes. In the second round of voting, Kaczyński received 54.04% of the vote, defeating Donald Tusk, who received 45.96% of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 23 December 2005.\\nOn 10 July 2006, Kaczyński appointed his brother as Prime Minister of Poland upon the resignation of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, the brothers then became the first pair of brothers in the world to serve as president and Prime Minister of a country and the only twin brothers to do so, until 2007, when his brother lost the parliamentary election on 21 October 2007, finishing a distant second behind the conservative-liberal party Civic Platform. His brother was succeeded as prime minister by his former presidential rival Donald Tusk.[3]\\nOn 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczyński died, along with his wife, in the crash of a Polish Air Force jet that occurred on a landing attempt at Smolensk North Airport in Russia.[4][5] He was the first Polish president to die in office since the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz.\\n\\n\\nEarly life[edit]\\nKaczyński was born in Warsaw, the son of Rajmund[6] (an engineer who served as a soldier of the Armia Krajowa in World War II and a veteran of the Warsaw Uprising),[7] and Jadwiga (a philologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences).[8] As a child, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, The Two Who Stole the Moon (Polish title O dwóch takich, co ukradli księżyc), with his identical twin brother Jarosław.\\nKaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980 he was awarded his PhD by Gdańsk University. In 1990 he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.\\n\\nOpposition to communism[edit]\\nIn the 1970s Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers\\' Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an anti-socialist element. After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity.\\nWhen Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Komitet Obywatelski Solidarność in 1988. From February to April 1989, he participated in the Round Table talks.\\n\\nPolitical activity from 1989–2005[edit]\\nKaczyński was elected senator in the elections of June 1989 and became the vice-chairman of the Solidarity trade union.[9] In the 1991 parliamentary election, he was elected to the parliament as a non-party member. He was, however, supported by the electoral committee Center Civic Alliance, closely related but not identical to the political party Centre Agreement (Porozumienie Centrum) led by his brother. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski\\'s government.[10]\\nKaczyński was the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control (Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, NIK) from February 1992 to May 1995[11] and later Minister of Justice and Attorney General in Jerzy Buzek\\'s government from June 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001. During this time he was very popular because of his strong stance against corruption.[12]\\n\\nLaw and Justice[edit]\\nIn 2001 he founded the political party Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość – PiS), usually labelled \\'conservative\\' by media, with his brother Jarosław. Lech Kaczyński was the president of the party between 2001 and 2003.[13]\\n\\nMayor of Warsaw[edit]\\nIn 2002, Kaczyński was elected mayor of Warsaw in a landslide victory.[14] He started his term in office by declaring war on corruption. He strongly supported the construction of the Warsaw Uprising Museum and in 2004 appointed a historical panel to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by the Germans in the Second World War (an estimated 85% of the city was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising) as a direct response to heightened claims coming from German expellees from Poland. The panel estimated the losses to be at least 45.3\\xa0billion euros ($54\\xa0billion) in current value. He also supported the construction of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and was one of the signatories of the agreement to finance the project using the city funds.[15]\\n\\nInterference with LGBT events[edit]\\nKaczyński banned the Warsaw gay pride parade twice in 2004 and again in 2005, locally known as the Parada Równości (the Equality Parade), telling protesters that \"I respect your right to demonstrate as citizens, but not as homosexuals.\"[16] Additionally, he feared the parade would promote a \"homosexual lifestyle\" and complained that police did not use enough force in breaking it up by stating \"Why was force not used to break up an illegal demonstration?\".[17][18] Kaczyński referred to the organizers of the gay pride parades as \"perverts\".[19]\\nIn 2005, Kaczyński allowed a counter-demonstration, the \"Parade of Normality\",[20] organized by the All-Polish Youth, a Catholic nationalist organization opposed to \"liberalism, tolerance, and relativism.\"\\nIn 2007, Poland was found guilty by the European Court of Human Rights of violating the principle of freedom of assembly by banning the 2005 Parada Równości under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[21][22][23]\\n\\nPresidency 2005–2010[edit]\\nPresidential election[edit]\\nMain article: 2005 Polish presidential election\\nOn 19 March 2005, he formally declared his intention to run for president in the October 2005 election.\\nIn the first round of the elections he polled 33% of the vote, taking second place behind Donald Tusk. By the second round, however, he had gained the support of Radio Maryja, as well as of two other political parties besides his own: Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, and the Polish People\\'s Party.\\nElected President of the Republic of Poland (he defeated the runner-up Donald Tusk by polling 8,257,468 votes, constituting 54.04 percent of the vote), Kaczyński assumed office on 23 December 2005, taking an oath before the National Assembly.\\n\\nDomestic policy[edit]\\nLech Kaczyński with U.S. President George W. Bush in 2007\\nIn his first public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his presidency would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of \"purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime [...], particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain unjust enrichment, a rush that is poisoning society, [and preventing the state from ensuring] elementary social security, health security, basic conditions for the development of the family [and] the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.[24]\\nDuring his inauguration he stated several goals he would pursue during his presidency. Among those concerning internal affairs were: increasing social solidarity in Poland, bringing justice to those who were responsible for, or were affected by communist crimes in the People\\'s Republic of Poland, fighting corruption, providing security in economy, and safety for development of family. Kaczyński also stated that he would seek to abolish economic inequalities between various regions of Poland. In his speech he also emphasized combining modernization with tradition and remembering the teachings of Pope John Paul II.\\nOn 21 December 2008, Kaczyński became the first Polish head of state to visit a Polish synagogue and to attend religious services held there. His attendance coincided with the first night of Hanukkah.[25]\\nKaczyński supported the reintroducing the death penalty in Poland, clashing with the European Union over the issue in 2006.[26][27][28]\\n\\nPresidential pardons[edit]\\nFrom 2005 to 2007, in accordance with article 133 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Kaczyński pardoned 77 people and declined to pardon 550.\\n\\nForeign affairs[edit]\\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (April 2009)\\nMeeting with his Lithuanian counterpart, Dalia Grybauskaitė, in Vilnius at the Presidential Palace, 8 April 2010. This was to be Kaczyński\\'s last meeting with a fellow head of state.\\nIn foreign policy, Kaczyński noted that many of Poland\\'s problems were related to the lack of energy security and this issue would have to be resolved to protect Polish interests. Strengthening ties with the United States while continuing to develop relations within the European Union are two main goals of Polish foreign affairs, as well as improving relations with France and Germany despite several problems in relations with the latter.\\nAside from those issues, his immediate goals were to develop a tangible strategic partnership with Ukraine and greater co-operation with the Baltic states, Azerbaijan and Georgia.\\nHe was greatly admired in Israel because he promoted educating Polish youth about the Holocaust. There was widespread grief in Israel over his death.[29]\\nDefense Minister Radosław Sikorski compared the planned Russia to Germany gas pipeline to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga stated that the pipeline was a threat to Poland\\'s energy security.[30]\\nIn November 2006 in Helsinki, at a European Union-Russia meeting, Poland vetoed the launch of EU-Russia partnership talks due to a Russian ban on Polish meat and plant products imports.[31]\\n\\nLech Kaczyński and president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, 2008\\nAs a reaction to claims by a German exile group Preussische Treuhand, which represents post-1945 German expellees from Eastern Europe, the Polish Foreign Minister Fotyga mistakenly threatened to reopen a 1990 Treaty fixing the Oder and Neisse rivers as the border between the two countries instead of the Neighborhood Treaty signed in the same year.[32][33]\\nFollowing the military conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Kaczyński provided the website of the President of Poland for dissemination of information for blocked by the Russian Federation Georgian internet portals. In a speech during the Russian aggression against Georgia, Kaczyński predicted: \"Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the Baltic States the day after tomorrow, and then perhaps the time will come for my country, Poland!\"[34]\\nDuring a state visit to Serbia in 2009, Kaczyński said that the Polish government, on the basis of its constitutional competences, decided to recognize Kosovo and emphasized that he, as the President of the state, did not agree with that.[35]\\n\\nMarriage and family[edit]\\nKaczyński married economist Maria Kaczyńska in 1978.[36] They had one daughter, Marta Kaczyńska-Dubieniecka. His brother is Jarosław Kaczyński, the former Prime Minister of Poland.[37]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nMain article: Smolensk air disaster\\nThe wreckage of the Tu-154 at the scene of the crash\\nOn 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154M plane was carrying Lech Kaczyński, his wife Maria Kaczyńska, and other members of a Polish delegation (top public and military figures) from Warsaw to commemorate the Katyn massacre. The plane crashed while approaching Smolensk Air Base in Russia. The governor of Smolensk Oblast confirmed to the Russia 24 news channel that there were no survivors.[38] 96 people were killed in the crash, including many of Poland\\'s highest military and civilian leaders.[39][40]\\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a government commission to investigate the crash. Russia\\'s Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, was placed in charge of the investigation.[41]\\nRussian politician Valeriya Novodvorskaya later claimed the Russian government had murdered Kaczyński.[42]\\n\\nState funeral[edit]\\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczyński\\nSarcophagus of Lech and Maria in the Crypt Under the Tower of Silver Bells, Kraków\\nOn 11 April 2010, President Kaczyński\\'s body was returned to Poland,[43] where he and his wife lay in state at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.[44] The state funeral was held in Kraków on 18 April 2010. After a Roman Catholic Mass at St. Mary\\'s Basilica,[45] the presidential couple were laid to rest in a coffin, which was placed in the antechamber of the Crypt Under the Tower of Silver Bells beneath the Wawel Cathedral.[46][47][48] A significant number of foreign dignitaries were unable to attend the funeral as a result of air travel disruption in Europe following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland.[49]\\n\\nExhumation and post-mortem[edit]\\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczyński\\nIn June 2016, the Polish government announced it would re-open the investigation into the Smolensk jet crash with plans to exhume and autopsy all 96 of the victims.[50] On 14 November 2016, the first of ten bodies, including Kaczyński\\'s, were exhumed.[51] Kaczyński and his wife were reburied on 18 November 2016 after autopsies.[52]\\nBy 1 June 2017, exhumations of 27 coffins had been completed and DNA tests confirmed that 24 of those coffins, Kaczyński\\'s among them, showed evidence of mix-ups, including switched bodies, partial sets of remains and multiple remains in one grave.[53]\\n\\n\\nHonours and awards[edit]\\nThe statue of Lech Kaczyński in Piłsudski Square, Warsaw\\nNational honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Poland:\\n Knight of the Order of the White Eagle\\n Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta\\nForeign honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Azerbaijan:\\n Recipient of the Heydar Aliyev Order (2 July 2009)\\n\\xa0Croatia:\\n Recipient of the Grand Order of King Tomislav (10 January 2008)\\n\\xa0Czech Republic:\\n Member 1st Class of the Order of the White Lion (21 January 2010)\\n\\xa0Georgia:\\n Recipient of the Order of National Hero of Georgia (posthumously, 10 April 2010)[54]\\n Recipient of the St. George\\'s Order of Victory (23 November 2007)\\n\\xa0Hungary:\\n Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (18 March 2009)\\n\\xa0Lithuania:\\n Commander Grand Cross with Golden Chain of the Order of Vytautas the Great (16 April 2009)\\n\\xa0Sovereign Military Order of Malta:\\n Collar of the Order pro Merito Melitensi (26 February 2009)\\n Grand Cross Special Class of the Order pro Merito Melitensi (14 May 2007)\\n\\xa0Portugal:\\n Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (2 September 2008)\\n\\xa0Romania:\\n Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania (7 October 2009)\\n\\xa0Saudi Arabia:\\n Collar of the Order of Abdulaziz al Saud (25 June 2007)\\n\\xa0Slovakia:\\n Member 1st Class of the Order of the White Double Cross (21 February 2009)[55]\\n\\xa0Ukraine:\\n Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (6 December 2007)\\nOther achievements[edit]\\n\\xa0Georgia\\xa0: Honorary doctorate from the Tbilisi State University in Georgia (16 April 2007)\\n\\xa0South Korea\\xa0: Honorary doctorate from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul (6 December 2008)\\n\\xa0Poland\\xa0: Honorary doctorate from Catholic University of Lublin (1 July 2009)\\n\\xa0Poland\\xa0: Honorary citizen of Warsaw (15 April 2010)\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Kaczynski Often a Source of Tension Within E.U.\" Obituary New York Times, 11 April 2010; page A12.\\n\\n^ \"Polish leader known as a feisty battler\" Obituary Los Angeles Times, 11 April 2010; page A13.\\n\\n^ \"Twin Kaczynski brothers become President and Prime Minister of Poland\".

As Marshal of the Sejm, Komorowski exercised the powers and duties of head of state following the death of President Lech Kaczyński in a plane crash on 10 April 2010.[1] Komorowski was then the governing Civic Platform party\\'s candidate in the resulting presidential election, which he won in the second round of voting on 4 July 2010. He was sworn in as president on 6 August 2010. Komorowski thus became the second person to serve on two occasions as Polish head of state since 1918, after Maciej Rataj. \\nOn 25 May 2015, Komorowski conceded the presidency of Poland to the rival candidate Andrzej Duda, after the latter won the second round of the 2015 presidential election.\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\nBronisław Maria Komorowski was born in Oborniki Śląskie. Born as a son of Zygmunt Leon Komorowski (1927–1992), professor of African Studies at the University of Warsaw and Jadwiga Komorowska (née Szalkowska) (b. 1921).[2]\\nFrom 1957 to 1959 he lived in Józefów near Otwock. From 1959 to 1966 he also attended elementary school in Pruszków. In 1966 he transferred to Warsaw and graduated from Cyprian Kamil Norwid High School no. 24. For many years he was affiliated with the Scout Movement.[3] During his studies he was a Scout instructor in 208 WDHiZ \"Parasol\" Battalion in Mokotów. He met his future wife through Scouting.[4]\\nIn 1977 he finished his studies in history at the University of Warsaw. From 1977 to 1980 he was an editor at the journal Słowo Powszechne.\\n\\nDissident activity[edit]\\nIn the Polish People\\'s Republic, Komorowski took part in the democratic movement as an underground publisher and co-operated with Antoni Macierewicz[5] on the monthly Głos (1977–1981).[5]\\nIn 1980, he was sentenced along with activists of the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights to one month in prison for organizing a demonstration on 11 November 1979[6] (the judge who presided the trial was Andrzej Kryże).[6]\\nFrom 1980 to 1981, he worked in the Centre of Social Investigation of NSZZ \"Solidarity\".[6] On 27 September 1981, he was one of the signatories of the founding declaration of the Clubs in the Service of Independence.[6] He was interned while Poland was under martial law.[6] From 1981 to 1989, he taught at the Lower Seminary in Niepokalanów.[6]\\n\\nThird Republic[edit]\\nBronisław Komorowski as Deputy Marshal in Sejm, September 2007\\nFrom 1989 to 1990, he was the manager minister Aleksander Hall\\'s office, and from 1990 to 1993, the civil vice minister of national defence in the governments of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and Hanna Suchocka. In the early 1990s he was involved with the Democratic Union and Freedom Union. From 1993 to 1995, he was the general secretary of these parties.[7]\\n\\nBronisław Komorowski with Lech Kaczyński and Nicolas Sarkozy\\nAs a candidate of the Democratic Union he was elected to parliament in 1991 and in 1993. In 1997, during the 2nd Sejm, together with a group of Warsaw University activists under the management of Jan Rokita he created Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe. In the same year Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe joined the newly created Conservative People\\'s Party (SKL), which joined Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS).[8]\\nIn September 1997 Komorowski was elected as a candidate of AWS. From 1997 to 2000 he presided over the Parliamentary National Defence Committee, and from 2000 to 2001 served as the minister of national defence in the government of Jerzy Buzek. In 2001, while still a minister in the minority AWS government, Komorowski, along with some activists from SKL, became a member of Civic Platform (PO). He stood for election to the 4th Sejm as a candidate of PO. Again he was elected, this time for the Warsaw constituency.[9]\\nAfter the inauguration of the new parliament he resigned from SKL. Since 2001 he has been a member of the National Civic Platform Board. In the 4th Sejm he was the deputy chairman of the Parliamentary National Defence Committee and a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs.[9]\\nHe won election to the 5th Sejm in a district outside Warsaw. On 26 October 2005, he was elected Vice Speaker of the Sejm. 398 MPs voted in favour of his candidacy. His party had earlier recommended him as a candidate for Speaker. His candidacy, in defiance of precedent, was rejected by Law and Justice (PiS) which voted for Marek Jurek. This created an unfavourable climate further discussions regarding a PO-PiS coalition.\\nAfter the resignation of Marek Jurek as Speaker of the Sejm on 25 April 2007 Civic Platform announced Komorowski\\'s candidacy for Speaker. On 27 April 2007 the Sejm rejected his nomination, and Ludwik Dorn from PiS became a new marshal. 189 MPs voted for Komorowski. Komorowski became Deputy Marshal.\\nKomorowski took first place on the PO list for the Warsaw constituency in the 2007 parliamentary election and received 139,320 votes.[10]\\n\\nMarshal of the Sejm[edit]\\nOn 5 November 2007, in the first session of the 6th Sejm of the Polish Republic Bronisław Komorowski was elected Speaker by 292 votes. He stood against Krzysztof Putra from PiS who received 160 votes. Stefan Niesiołowski, Krzysztof Putra, Jarosław Kalinowski, Jerzy Szmajdziński were elected Vice Speakers.[citation needed]\\nOn 27 March 2010, he was chosen by PO members to be their candidate in 2010 presidential election.\\n\\nPresident of Poland[edit]\\nActing President[edit]\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with two former presidents, Lech Wałęsa and Aleksander Kwaśniewski\\nKomorowski became acting president on 10 April 2010 following the death of President Lech Kaczyński. His first decision was to announce seven days of national mourning beginning on 10 April.[11]\\nAccording to the Constitution of Poland, Komorowski was required to set a date for the next presidential election within 14 days of assuming the position, the election date coming within 60 days of that announcement. On 21 April, his office announced that the election would be held on 20 June.[12]\\nIn the election, he got 41.54% of votes in the first round and then faced Jarosław Kaczyński, who got 36.46% of votes in the first round. In the runoff Komorowski was elected president (8 933 887 valid votes, 53,01%) and formally took office on 6 August 2010.[13]\\n\\nPresidency[edit]\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski during his inaugural speech in front of the National Assembly\\nBronisław Komorowski with his successor Andrzej Duda and their spouses in Warsaw, 6 August 2015\\nFollowing the death of Władysław Stasiak, the chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland, Komorowski appointed Jacek Michałowski to succeed him on an acting basis.[14] A high number of vacancies following the Smolensk crash necessitated numerous other appointments. On 12 April, he appointed retired General Stanisław Koziej head of the National Security Bureau in place of the late Aleksander Szczygło.[15]\\nOn 29 April 2010, Komorowski signed into law a parliamentary act that reformed the Institute of National Remembrance.[16]\\nOn 27 May 2010, Komorowski nominated Marek Belka, former Finance Minister and Prime Minister (2004–2005) of a then-leftist government, to be the president of the National Bank of Poland in place of the late Sławomir Skrzypek.[17]\\nFollowing his election, Komorowski announced that he would resign from the Sejm on 8 July 2010, and thus cease to be a marshal and an acting president (his successor as an acting president was the next marshal of the Sejm Grzegorz Schetyna, who held the position for about a month before Komorowski\\'s formal inauguration).[18] Komorowski currently resides and works in the Belweder Palace instead of the Presidential Palace.[citation needed]\\nOn 25 May 2015, following his defeat in the second round of the 2015 presidential election, Komorowski conceded the presidency to rival Andrzej Duda, after the latter won a 51.5% majority.[19] His term ended on 6 August 2015, when Duda was sworn in as a new president.\\n\\nAttitude towards Ukraine[edit]\\nOn 22 February 2015 he supported the idea of the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko to introduce a UN peacekeeping mission in Donbass.[20]\\nOn 9 April, during a visit to Kyiv, he spoke from the rostrum of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. During his speech, he stated: \"There will be no stable, secure Europe if Ukraine does not become part of it, and only the blind can not see the presence of Russian troops in the Donbas.\" Politicians in Ukraine and Poland called the speech historic.[21]\\nOn 2 July he visited Lviv, where he received an honorary doctorate from Lviv University. During a joint press conference with Poroshenko, he stated that he would create his own institute to deal with Polish-Ukrainian relations.[22][23]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nKomorowski has been married to Anna Dembowska (born 1954) since 1977. The couple has five children namely Zofia Aleksandra (born 1979), Tadeusz Jan (born 1981), Maria Anna (born 1983), Piotr Zygmunt (born 1985) and Elżbieta Jadwiga (born 1987).[citation needed]\\n\\nHonours and awards[edit]\\nNational honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Poland:\\nKnight of the Order of the White Eagle (ex officio)\\nGrand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (ex officio)\\nForeign honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Croatia: Recipient of the Grand Order of King Tomislav (8 May 2013)\\n\\xa0Estonia: Collar of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (14 March 2014)\\n\\xa0France: Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour (16 November 2012)[24][25]\\n\\xa0Greece: Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer (8 July 2013)\\n\\xa0Italy: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (10 June 2012)\\n\\xa0Latvia: Commander Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of the Three Stars (23 November 2012)\\n\\xa0Malta: Honorary Companion of Honour of the National Order of Merit (2009)\\n\\xa0Monaco: Knight Grand Officer of the Order of Saint Charles (October 2012)[26]\\n\\xa0Netherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (24 June 2014)\\n\\xa0North Macedonia: Recipient of the Order 8-September (September 2013)[27]\\n\\xa0Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (9 May 2012)\\n\\xa0Portugal: Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (19 April 2012)\\n\\xa0Slovakia: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Double Cross (20 May 2014)\\n\\xa0Sweden: Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (4 May 2011)\\n\\xa0Ukraine: Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (2008)[28]\\nDistinctions[edit]\\n\\xa0Lithuania:\\nDoctor honoris causa of the Mykolas Romeris University in Vilnius, Lithuania (14 January 2008)\\nDoctor honoris causa of the Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania (June 2015)[29]\\nState visits gallery[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Barack Obama (Washington, 2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with President Dmitry Medvedev (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy (2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Dalia Grybauskaitė (2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Christian Wulff (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Valdis Dombrovskis (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Herman Van Rompuy (2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Victor Yanukovych (2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Mykola Azarov (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Pope Benedict XVI (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Abdullah Gül (2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Barack Obama (Warsaw, 2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Joachim Gauck (2012)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Park Geun-hye (2013)\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bronisław Komorowski with Chuck Hagel (2014)\\n\\n\\nFootnotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Parliament Head Komorowski Becomes Poland President after Kaczynski\\'s Death\". novinite.com. 10 April 2010.

Before becoming President, he served as Member of the Sejm (MP) from 2011 to 2014 and as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2014 to 2015.\\nDuda was the presidential candidate for the Law and Justice party (PiS) during the presidential election in May 2015. In the first round of voting, he received 5,179,092 votes – 34.76% of valid votes. In the second round of voting, he received 51.55% of the vote, beating the former president Bronisław Komorowski, who received 48.45% of the vote. On 26 May 2015, Duda resigned his party membership as the president-elect.\\nOn 24 October 2019, he received the official support of PiS ahead of his re-election campaign in 2020. He finished first in the first round and then went on to defeat Rafał Trzaskowski in the runoff with 10,440,648 votes or 51.03% of the vote.[1] Throughout his first and second terms, Duda has largely aligned himself with the right-wing ideologies espoused by PiS and its leader Jarosław Kaczyński. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Duda has played an important role in coordinating international efforts to support Ukraine\\'s military.[2]\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\nDuda was born on 16 May 1972 in Kraków, to Janina (Milewska) and Jan Tadeusz Duda, professors at the AGH University of Science and Technology. His grandfather fought in the Polish–Soviet War and later was a member of the Home Army during the Second World War.[3]\\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Duda attended Jan III Sobieski High School, Kraków, where he excelled in Humanities.[4] He subsequently studied law at the Jagiellonian University, and earned a law degree. In 2001, he was appointed as a research assistant in the Department of Administrative Law of the Jagiellonian University\\'s Faculty of Law and Administration. In January 2005, Duda earned a Doctor of Law degree (LL.D.) at the Jagiellonian University. Due to his political career, he has been mostly on unpaid leave from the university since September 2006, except for a 13-month interval beginning in September 2010, when he returned to the university.[5] Additionally, he was a lecturer at Mieszko I College of Education and Administration, Poznań.[6]\\n\\nPolitical career[edit]\\nPresident Lech Kaczyński appointing Duda as undersecretary of state in the Chancellery of the President, 16 January 2008\\nDuda began his political career with the now defunct Freedom Union Party in the early 2000s. After the parliamentary elections in 2005, he began his collaboration with the Law and Justice Party (PiS).[7] He was an undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Justice between 2006 and 2007 before becoming a member of Polish State Tribunal from 2007 until 2008.\\nFrom 2008 to 2010, during the presidency of Lech Kaczyński, Duda was an undersecretary of state in the Chancellery of the President.[8] In 2010, he was an unsuccessful candidate to become the Mayor of Kraków as a PiS candidate,[9] but was more successful in the 2011 parliamentary election, where he received 79,981 votes for the Kraków area, and thus became a member of the Sejm.[10]\\nIn September 2013, the news magazine Polityka commended Duda for being one of the most active members of parliament, describing him as being open to opposition arguments and as refraining from personal attacks, as part of his role at the Commission for Constitutional Responsibility.[11] Duda remained a member of the Sejm until he was elected to the European Parliament in 2014.[12]\\n\\n2015 presidential campaign[edit]\\nMain article: 2015 Polish presidential election\\nAs Bronisław Komorowski\\'s presidential term was expiring, Komorowski was able to seek re-election in a scheduled presidential election. Duda was Komorowski\\'s Law and Justice rival in the election.\\nIn the first round of the 2015 presidential election, Duda came first, receiving 5,179,092 votes and thus 34.76% of valid votes.[13]\\nIn the second round Duda took 51.55% of the vote against the 48.45% share of his rival, the incumbent president Bronisław Komorowski.[14] On 26 May 2015, he officially resigned from party membership;[15] recent precedent calls for the president to not be a formal member of a political party.\\n\\n2020 presidential campaign[edit]\\nMain article: 2020 Polish presidential election\\nIn the first round of the 2020 presidential election, Duda appeared to come in first, receiving almost 44% of the votes. Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski came in second, with just over 30% of the vote. The second round took place on 12 July.[16] Duda won reelection.[17]\\n\\nPresidency (2015–present)[edit]\\nAndrzej Duda taking the oath of office, 6 August 2015\\nDuda and Xi Jinping signed a declaration on strategic partnership\\nDuda with U.S. President Joe Biden in Warsaw\\nThe first five-year term of Andrzej Duda began on 6 August 2015 with taking an oath of office during a National Assembly session.[18]\\nDuda rejected the European Union\\'s proposal of migrant quotas to redistribute asylum seekers, saying: \"I won\\'t agree to a dictate of the strong. I won\\'t back a Europe where the economic advantage of the size of a population will be a reason to force solutions on other countries regardless of their national interests\".[19]\\nIn September 2015 Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz declared that Poland, as an expression of \"European solidarity\", would take in 2,000 people over the next two years, mainly from Syria and Eritrea (out of 3,700 originally requested).[20]\\nDuda and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović were the originators of the Three Seas Initiative.[21]\\nDuda repeatedly met with general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping,[22][23] stating that \"Polish companies will benefit hugely\" from China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative.[24] Duda and Xi signed a declaration on strategic partnership in which they reiterated that Poland and China viewed each other as long-term strategic partners.[25] Duda said that he hopes Poland will become a gateway to Europe for China.[26]\\nIn September 2017, his approval rating stood at 71% and in February 2018, at 72%, a record surpassed only by Aleksander Kwaśniewski, whose approval ratings surpassed 75% from 1995 to 2005.[27][28]\\nOn 6 June 2023, Duda presented three goals of Poland\\'s presidency in the European Union in the first half of 2025. The first goal is to deepen transatlantic cooperation and strengthen the relationship between the European Union and the United States. The second goal is to further expand the community to include Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans, and in the future, other aspiring countries as well. The third goal will be to enhance Europe\\'s energy security.[29]\\n\\nPardon of Mariusz Kamiński[edit]\\nIn November 2015, on the basis of Article 139 of the Constitution of Poland, Duda pardoned former Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) head Mariusz Kamiński and three CBA officers convicted by a court of 1st instance in the so-called \"Land Affair\"\\xa0[pl],[30] marking the first pardon granted by a president before reaching a final verdict.\\n[31]  According to some lawyers (including professors Jan Zimmermann – Andrzej Duda\\'s doctorate promoter, Leszek Kubicki – former Minister of Justice and Andrzej Zoll – former president of the Constitutional Tribunal) Duda breached the Constitution of Poland.[32][33][34]\\n\\nConstitutional crisis[edit]\\nMain article: 2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis\\nAndrzej Duda during a meeting with the Council of Seniors of the Sejm and the Council of Seniors of the Senate at the Sejm\\nAndrzej Duda refused to swear in any of the five Constitutional Tribunal judge candidates selected by the Sejm of the VII term. Three of them had been selected since 7 November 2015 whose election was declared constitutional.[35] Between 3 and 9 December 2015, Duda swore in five other candidates for the same office selected by the Sejm of the VIII term.[36][37]\\nOn 28 December 2015, Duda signed the Constitutional Tribunal bill (passed on 22 December 2015 by the Sejm), which unequivocally breaches the Constitution of Poland according to the National Council of the Judiciary of Poland,[38] the Public Prosecutor General[39] and the Polish Ombudsman.[40]\\nIn July 2017, Duda informed the public he had decided to veto two controversial judicial bills backed by the government and passed by both houses of the Polish parliament. The President\\'s spokesman subsequently said that the third act – the common courts bill – would be signed.[41] The veto was just one example of Duda opposing the policies of PiS.[42]\\n\\nPolitics of memory and the Holocaust[edit]\\nIn February 2018, Duda said that he would sign into law the Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, making it illegal to accuse \\'the Polish nation\\' of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi German atrocities, a measure that has roiled relations with Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going as far as accusing the Polish government of \"Holocaust denial\".[43][44][45]\\nIn September 2022, Duda and his wife attended the funeral of Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg in the United States, and Duda announced that he was awarding Mosberg the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, the highest Polish award in its class.[46] He awarded it in recognition of Mosberg\\'s achievements in advancing Polish-Jewish dialogue and developing cooperation between nations, and for preserving the memory of and communicating what happened in the Holocaust.[46]\\n\\nStance on LGBT rights[edit]\\nMain articles: LGBT rights in Poland and LGBT ideology-free zone\\nIn June 2020, Duda said that he would not allow gay couples to marry or adopt children, while describing the LGBT movement as \"a foreign ideology\" and comparing it to indoctrination in the Soviet Union. He also pledged he would ban LGBT teaching in schools.[47][48][49][50] In response to Duda\\'s comments, former Prime Minister of Belgium Elio Di Rupo publicly asked the European Commission for an official reaction.[51][52][53] Soon after his comments, Duda invited presidential candidate Robert Biedroń (who had asked to meet the president)[54] and an LGBT activist, Bartosz Staszewski, to the Presidential Palace,[55][56] though Robert Biedroń eventually turned down the invitation, refusing to meet President Duda until he apologized.[57] According to Staszewski, during their meeting Duda cited freedom of speech to defend his words about \"LGBT ideology\".[55]\\nOn 4 July 2020, Duda proposed changing the constitution to ban LGBT couples from adopting children. On 6 July 2020, he signed a document with a presidential draft of the amendment to the Polish Constitution.[58][59][60]\\n\\nForeign policy[edit]\\nDuda with Bulgarian President Rumen Radev in Sofia, in 27 November 2018\\nDuda was the first foreign leader to travel to the White House since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.[61]\\nDuda with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in New York, 21 September 2021\\nAndrzej Duda in Ukraine in April 2022\\nDuda with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Rome, in 18 October 2022\\nDuda, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Gitanas Nausėda held a meeting in the format of the Lublin Triangle in Lviv, Ukraine, 11 January 2023\\nIn October 2017, he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and supported Turkey\\'s accession to the European Union.[62]\\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised Duda, saying: \"He\\'s doing a terrific job.\"[63][64] In September 2019, Trump and Duda agreed to send 1,000 U.S. troops to Poland.[65]\\nOn 24 June 2020, Trump said at a press conference with Duda that the United States planned to move some U.S. troops from Germany to Poland.[66][67] Trump said that \"Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO — in particular, their monetary obligations — and they asked us if we would send some additional troops. They\\'re going to pay for that.\"[68]\\nIn February 2022, Duda attended the opening ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games in Beijing and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Some Polish diplomats criticised Duda\\'s visit to China because some of Poland\\'s Western allies boycotted the Winter Olympics in China due to the alleged Uyghur genocide and other human rights abuses in China.[69]\\nIn October 2022, Duda declared that Poland would be willing to host U.S. nuclear weapons.[70]\\nIn March 2023, Duda visited gas-rich Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He focused on energy security and cooperation.[71]\\nOn 7 October 2023, he condemned Hamas\\' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[72]\\n\\nLex Tusk[edit]\\nSee also: 2023 Polish protests §\\xa0Lex Tusk law\\nOn 29 May 2023, during a press conference, Duda announced the intention to sign the \"Lex Tusk\", a law establishing a commission to investigate Russian influence in Poland. According to the law, the commission is expected to publish its first report in September before the parliamentary elections. The law reached the president\\'s desk after the Sejm rejected the Senate\\'s veto on the matter on 26 May. The Senate recommended the rejection of the law in its entirety due to its anti-democratic nature, numerous errors, and 13 potential violations of the constitution.[73][74] On 7 June 2023, the European Commission initiated legal proceedings against Poland regarding the extensively debated law. Brussels was concerned that the law might to used to target opposition politicians in the country\\'s general election which was scheduled, and took place, in late 2023.[75][76]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nDuda is married to Agata Kornhauser-Duda, a teacher of German at Jan III Sobieski High School in Kraków.[77] They met as high school students, at a party.[3] The couple have been married since 21 December 1994.[78] They have one daughter named Kinga (b. 1995).[79] Duda\\'s father-in-law is Julian Kornhauser, a well-known writer, translator and literary critic.[80]\\nDuda is a keen skier, and he participated in the Polish Academic Championships in Alpine skiing while he was a university student.[3]\\nDuda is a practising Roman Catholic. He took part in religious ceremonies on many occasions, including Midnight Mass, the blessing of food on Holy Saturday, and the Corpus Christi procession in Kraków.[81][82][83]\\n\\nHonours[edit]\\nNational honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Poland: Order of the White Eagle (ex officio)\\n\\xa0Poland: Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (ex officio)\\nForeign honours[edit]\\n\\xa0Belgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold (2015)\\n\\xa0Bulgaria: I Class Order of Stara Planina (Стара планина) (14 April 2016)[84]\\n\\xa0Czech Republic: Collar of the Order of the White Lion (15 March 2016)\\n\\xa0Finland: Grand Cross with Collar Order of the White Rose of Finland (2017)\\n\\xa0Greece: Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer (2017)\\n\\xa0Italy: Knight Grand Cross decorated with Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (17 April 2023)[85]\\n\\xa0Latvia: Commander Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of the Three Stars (2018)\\n\\xa0Lithuania: Grand Cross with Golden Chain of the Order of Vytautas the Great (21 February 2019)[86]\\n\\xa0Norway: Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (23 May 2016)\\n\\xa0Portugal: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit Grand Cross (2008)[87]\\n\\xa0Romania: Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania (10 July 2016)\\n\\xa0Slovakia: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Double Cross (2019)\\n\\xa0Hungary: Grand Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit (2020)[88]\\n\\xa0Ukraine: Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 1st class (2021)[89]\\n\\xa0International Olympic Committee: Gold Olympic Order (23 July 2022)[90]\\n\\xa0North Macedonia: Grand Cross of the Order 8-September (24 October 2022)[91]\\n\\xa0South Korea: Grand Order of Mugunghwa (13 July 2023)[92]\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Pronounced in English /ˈɑːndʒeɪ ˈduːdə/ AHN-jay DOO-də\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Wybory Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej w 2020 r.\" wybory.gov.pl (in Polish).
